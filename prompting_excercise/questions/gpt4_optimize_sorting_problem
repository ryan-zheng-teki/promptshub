the following is a compiled version of a sorting algorithm in assembly. i think it can be improved , can you indicate in the following lines, with *** which instructions could be removed, or changed? if not don't do anything, take it step by step and explain the reasoning, and go back and verify that it was correct

Memory[0] = A
Memory[1] = B
Memory[2] = c

mov Memory[0] P
mov Memory[1] Q
mov Memory[2] R

mov R S
cmp P R
cmovg P R // this is equivalent to  R = max(A, C)
cmovl P S // this is equivalent to S = min(A, C)
mov S P // this is equivalent to P = min(A, C)
cmp S Q
cmovg Q P // this is equialent to P = min(A, B, C)
cmovg S Q // this is equivalent to Q = max(min(A, C), B)

mov P Memory[0] // this is equivalent to = min(A, B, C)
mov Q Memory[1] // this is equivalent to = max(min(A, C), B)
mov R Memory[2] // this is equivalent to = max(A, C)



go over the above instructions in steps that make sense, don't say as a first pass if they can be removed or changed, just look at them and express some written thoughts that may help you in the second step. 

First step first, then you ask me to move on to step two. Be very detailed, and VERY careful
