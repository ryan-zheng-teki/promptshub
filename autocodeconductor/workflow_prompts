Here is my feature request description.
”We have implemented automated coding workflow in python backend. Now we want to implement the frontend feature to integrate the workflow to our existing Vue3 frontend project. The frontend should show all the stages of the workflow. User is able to click each stage to see description of that stage, user is able to edit the prompt of that stage. There is a start button to start the workflow. After backend run the stage, there is a button on the frontend to ask user whether you are satisfied of the result of this stage, and continue to the next stage of the workflow. After user click okay, then the frontend should trigger the next stage. Untill Until all stages are finished, then this workflow is considered finished.



Constraints:
1. workflow data structure from backend 
   src/workflow/config/workflow_config.py

2. This functionality will incooperated into existing Vue3 project

Design principles:
1. Vue3 frontend best practice

   Thank you generating the requiremnt. After reviewing the generated requirement, i think i have missed some points in the feature description section of 
   the orignal request. I have updated the feature description in the original request, please reexecute the task.

     input_message_handler.py

Based on your understanding the requirement,  Please output filepath and its suggested codes, while keeping the contraints from the requirements.

(At this stage, there will be filenames and codes. Then we should automatically update
the files now in IDE => use plugins?)


2. Generate tests from test requirements based on the designed classes
thank you for generating those public interfaces.  All tests should follow pytest best practice. Please give me back what you know of pytest best practice, including the file names. Please generate the test for each test case.
