The task name is 'CodeAnalysisAndErrorResolution'. In this task, you will perform an in-depth analysis of a provided error message and the associated source code. Your task is to identify the root cause of the error, propose a solution, and then present the corrected version of the code. 

Please follow these standards:

1. Start by examining the error message, which you will find in the `>>Error<<` section. Use your analysis of this error message to generate an initial hypothesis about its cause. 

2. Subsequently, refer to the `>>ReferencedCode<<` section, examining the source code thoroughly and progressively. Your analysis should be broken down into several steps, rather than jumping to conclusions in a single leap.

3. In your response, clearly articulate the reasoning process behind each step of your analysis. Use the following structure as a guide: 

    "The error message indicates that the issue is caused by ____. Looking at the source code, we can see that the code performs ____, ____, and ____. These actions result in ____ , which is likely the cause of the reported error."

4. After identifying the source of the error, propose and implement a solution within the source code. Document any changes made clearly, explaining why each change is necessary and how it resolves the identified issue.

5. Finally, present the modified code in a copyable code block, ensuring the output is formatted appropriately for easy replication and application. 

Remember to maintain a logical and coherent flow throughout your analysis, and ensure that your explanations are clear and easily understandable. This task isn't just about finding and resolving the issue, but also about demonstrating a methodical, step-by-step approach to error resolution.

This module contains the SourceCodeParser class which provides functionality to parse Python source code files.

The SourceCodeParser class has a method `parse_source_code` that takes a Python file's path as input, reads
the source code from the file, parses it, and extracts its module-level docstring, functions, classes,
and their associated docstrings. 

It returns a ModuleEntity object representing the module, containing FunctionEntity objects for each function

Identified Domain: Software Debugging and Problem-solving

Optimized Prompt:

The task name is "Software Error Analysis and Resolution". In this task, you will perform a step-by-step examination of a presented software error and the associated source code. Your task is to deduce the root cause of the issue and recommend modifications to fix it.

Here are the instructions you need to follow:

1. Begin by analyzing the provided error message to identify what might be causing it.
2. Proceed to inspect the associated source code. Describe your observations on the function of different segments of the code. Avoid jumping to conclusions but maintain a sequential and methodical approach to the analysis.
3. Make connections between your findings from the error message and the source code inspection. Formulate a logical reasoning process to explain how certain aspects of the code might be leading to the error.
4. Based on your understanding, suggest appropriate code modifications that could potentially resolve the issue.

An example approach would be: "From the error message, it appears the issue is caused by ____. Now, let's examine the source code. This portion of the code does ___, and this other part does ___. Due to ____, it likely leads to the given error. Therefore, by modifying this part of the code, the error should be fixed."

Ensure your explanation is thorough and that the reasoning process behind your analysis is clearly conveyed. Remember, the aim is not only to fix the error but also to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue and its resolution.



I have one step by step analysis example as follows
"From the error message, it appears the issue is caused by ____. Now, let's examine the source code. This portion of the code does ___, and this other part does ___. Due to ____, it likely leads to the given error. Therefore, by modifying this part of the code, the error should be fixed."

But this example is for error analysis. Can you please create a similar example for converting requirement to architectural designs in the form of file names, 
classes, functions.
















Task: "Software Ticket Conversion to Design".

As a proficient software architect, you'll leverage your mastery of SOLID principles and clean code practices to transform the output of the preceding "Refine And Enhance Task Description" task into a cogent design.

Your design output, presented as filenames, class names, function names, and their descriptions, should strictly align with SOLID and clean code principles. However, the output should not include concrete implementations.

Break your analysis down into manageable steps, avoiding a sudden leap to the final design. Consider the following example for clarity:


Reasoning:
The first requirement is about 

Summary:
In accordance with the reasoning, the final design will comprise the following files and interfaces:

Class: BaseLLMIntegration 
Interface: send_message(arguments)
Description:
