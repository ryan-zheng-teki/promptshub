**Task Name:** Converting Software Ticket To Software Design

**Role:** Software Architect 

**Objective:** Translate software requirements into a software design, taking into account existing code. The final design should outline file names, classes, functions, and their descriptions, without including concrete implementations, and be ready to be turned into source code. 

**Guidelines:**

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    Start by thoroughly understanding the requirements. What is the software expected to do? What are its key features and functionalities?

2. **Identify Key Components:**
    Identify the main components or entities needed to fulfill the requirements. Consider existing code provided in the "Existing Code Section" and determine if any components can be reused or modified. Don't worry about specific classes or functions yet, just think in terms of high-level components or services.

3. **Define Component Interactions:**
    Once you've identified the key components, think about how they will interact with each other. Consider the existing code and its dependencies. What information will the new components need to share with the existing ones? What are the dependencies between them?

4. **Design the Components:**
    For each component, including both new and existing ones, start to think about what classes and functions it will need. Consider the structured information about existing code, such as file path, class descriptions, and function descriptions, and incorporate it into your design. Try to keep the SOLID principles in mind, but don't get too bogged down in them at this stage. Remember, you're not writing concrete implementations yet, just outlining what classes and functions you'll need.

5. **Refine the Design:**
    Now that you have a basic design, start refining it. Consider the existing code and its structure. Are there any parts that seem overly complex or that could be simplified? Are there any obvious improvements you could make? This is where you should start thinking more about clean code and SOLID principles. Refine the structured information about existing code, ensuring it accurately represents the relationships between files, classes, and functions.

6. **Create Concrete File Paths, Functions, and Descriptions:**
    In this final step, the goal is to create concrete file paths, functions, and their descriptions. Use the refined design as a basis and articulate the interfaces for the software components. The descriptions should be detailed and expressive, capturing the intended behavior and inputs/outputs of each function. While the implementations themselves are not provided at this stage, the descriptions will serve as a guide for writing the code in the implementation phase.

**Existing Code Reference Section:**
Provide a section in your guideline where you can document the existing code reference. Include structured information such as file paths, class descriptions, and function descriptions. This section will serve as a quick reference for understanding the existing code and incorporating it into your design. Place this section either before or after the "Guidelines" section, depending on your preference.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    Start by thoroughly understanding the requirements. What is the software expected to do? What are its key features and functionalities? Take into consideration any constraints or limitations that need to be addressed.

2. **Consider Constraints:**
    Identify any constraints or limitations that need to be taken into account during the design process. These may include framework constraints, technical constraints, security constraints or any other relevant restrictions.

3. **Identify Key Components:**
    Based on the understanding of requirements and constraints, identify the main components or entities needed to fulfill the requirements. Consider existing code provided in the "Existing Code Section" and determine if any components can be reused or modified. Don't worry about specific classes or functions yet, just think in terms of high-level components or services.

    In this final step, the goal is to create concrete file paths, functions, and their descriptions. Use the refined design


This approach gives you a set of guidelines that follows a heuristic, step-by-step process, emphasizing reasoning and thought process over a more rigid structure.
```

Here is one sample example which demonstrates how detailed reasoning process is employed to detect source code errors from a certain error message.

Example:
```
The error message indicates that the issue is caused by a TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation. Looking at the traceback, we can see that the error originates from line 44 in grpc_service.py when trying to assign a value to stage.stage_class.

The source code suggests that stage_data["stage_class"] is being assigned to stage.stage_class, implying that stage_data["stage_class"] is not of an appropriate type for this assignment. From the traceback and the code, it appears that stage_data is expected to be a dictionary and stage_class is expected to be a key within this dictionary.

The source code provided includes a comment that explains the structure of the WORKFLOW_CONFIG dictionary. According to the comment, the 'stage_class' key should correspond to a class representing the stage. We can see in config.py that stage_class values are indeed classes such as RequirementStage, DesignStage, etc.

Given that the error is a type error, and it arises when assigning stage_data["stage_class"] to stage.stage_class, the error might be due to stage.stage_class not being able to accept a class type as its value. Instead, it may require a string representation of the class name, an instance of the class, or some other form of data.

To resolve this issue, we need to identify the correct type for stage.stage_class and convert stage_data["stage_class"] to that type before assignment. Based on common practice with gRPC, protobufs generally do not support passing around class types or instances directly. Instead, they prefer to work with basic data types such as strings and integers. Therefore, it is likely that stage.stage_class is expecting a string.

Here's a possible solution: instead of assigning the class directly, we can assign the name of the class, as a string, to stage.stage_class.
```

Requirement:
I have created one AutomatedCodingWorkflow which contains multiple stages.
Here i can use grpc to show the workflow
grpcurl -d '{}' -proto autobyteus/src/proto/grpc_service.proto -plaintext localhost:50051 automatedcodingworkflow.AutomatedCodingWorkflowService/GetWorkflowConfig
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "stageName": "requirement",
      "stageClass": "RequirementStage",
      "stages": [
        {
          "stageName": "refine",
          "stageClass": "RequirementRefineStage"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "stageName": "design",
      "stageClass": "DesignStage"
    },
    {
      "stageName": "test_generation",
      "stageClass": "TestGenerationStage"
    },
    {
      "stageName": "implementation",

We have created a sequential guideline for software developer to convert requirement to softare designs ultimately in the form of filepath, classes, functions. Here is the guideline.

1. Understand the requirements: Begin by thoroughly comprehending the software requirements. Identify the key functionalities, user interactions. This step sets the foundation for the design process.

2. Define the system architecture: Based on the requirements, determine the overall structure and components of the software system. Consider the technical constraints such as the chosen technical stack, frameworks, and programming languages. Create a high-level design that outlines the major modules and their interactions.

3. Identify modules and components: Break down the system architecture into smaller modules or components. Each module should have well-defined responsibilities and interfaces. Identify the relationships and dependencies between the modules.

4. Design module interfaces: Define the interfaces for each module, specifying the input parameters, output results, and communication protocols. This step ensures that modules can interact seamlessly and efficiently.

5. Design classes and data structures: Within each module, design the classes and data structures that encapsulate the functionality. Consider the data flow, data storage, and algorithms required to implement the module's responsibilities.

6. Define class relationships: Establish the relationships between classes, such as inheritance, composition, or association. Determine the appropriate design patterns or architectural styles to enhance modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

7. Design functions and methods: Within each class, define the functions or methods that implement specific operations. Consider the input parameters, return values, and any necessary error handling.

8. Consider technical constraints: Throughout the design process, be mindful of the technical constraints, such as performance limitations, platform compatibility, and scalability requirements. Adjust the design accordingly to accommodate these constraints effectively.

9. Validate and refine: Review the design to ensure it aligns with the initial requirements and technical constraints. Seek feedback from stakeholders, architects, or peers. Refine the design as needed, considering alternative approaches and optimizations.


By following these sequential steps, akin to an ant's crawling journey, developers can systematically convert software requirements into concrete software designs. This approach allows for thoughtful reasoning, consideration of technical constraints, and the creation of a robust and well-structured software solution.

Now please use the guideline to address the following requirement
```
We have created one Vue3 WorkflowContainer.vue component
<template>
    <!-- Component Markup -->
</template>
  
<script lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted, onUnmounted } from 'vue';
import workflowService from '../services/WorkflowService'; // adjust the path as needed
import StageButton from './StageButton.vue';
import ProgressIndicator from './ProgressIndicator.vue';
import StageDetail from './StageDetail.vue';
import type { WorkflowCommand } from '../types/vscode';
import eventEmitter from "../services/EventEmitter";


export default {
  components: {
    StageButton,
    ProgressIndicator,
    StageDetail
  },
  setup() {
    const currentStage = ref(null);
    const stages = ref([]);

    const handleWorkflowStarted = (data: any)  => {
      stages.value = data;
    };

    onMounted(() => {
      eventEmitter.on('workflowStarted', handleWorkflowStarted);
    });

    onUnmounted(() => {
      eventEmitter.off('workflowStarted', handleWorkflowStarted);
    });

    const startWorkflow = () => {
      const startWorkflowCmd: WorkflowCommand = { name: 'startWorkflow'}
      workflowService.sendMessageToExtension(startWorkflowCmd);
    };

    return {
      currentStage,
      stages,
      startWorkflow,
      // Other reactive properties...
    };
  }
  // Other methods, lifecycle hooks...
}
</script>

As you can see the Container template is empty. Previously we have also design of the UI

Yes, software engineers typically follow a sequential and iterative approach when converting software requirements into software designs or updating existing codebases. This approach involves several steps that build upon each other, allowing for a systematic progression towards the desired outcome. I'll outline the general thinking process and provide a guideline resembling an ant's crawling journey.

1. Understanding the Requirements:
   - Begin by thoroughly understanding the software requirements. 
   - Break down the requirements into smaller, more manageable units, such as features or modules.

2. Analyse and Design:
   - Analyze the system or codebase to identify any existing components that can be reused or modified.
   - Identify the necessary new files, classes, or functions that need to be created based on the requirements.
   - Consider the constraints, such as performance, scalability, security, and maintainability.

3. High-Level Design:
   - Create a high-level design that outlines the overall structure of the software.
   - Define the major components, their interactions, and the flow of data between them.
   - Consider the architectural patterns or paradigms suitable for the project.

4. Detailed Design:
   - Dive deeper into each component and define their interfaces, responsibilities, and interactions in detail.
   - Consider the design patterns or best practices applicable to the specific problem domain.
   - Document the design decisions, including diagrams, class hierarchies, and relationships.

5. Implementation and Testing:
   - Begin implementing the designed components, following the guidelines and specifications.
   - Write clean, modular, and maintainable code, adhering to coding standards and practices.
   - Perform unit testing to ensure individual components work correctly.
