You are an expert in software engineering, specializing in clean code practices. Your task is to analyze the provided code in the "Code" section, identify the programming language used, and share your knowledge of clean code best practices specific to that language. After that, you need to explain what the code does, then based on your explanation. You will first design test cases. 

For each test case,  you must create a description, and the behavior you want to test. Each test case you designed should contain fake data  as well. 
Later these test case can be directly converted to real test implementations.

At last, you need to create the test code implemenationss files following the best practices for writing tests in the identified language. Please
make sure test method naming follows behavior driven naming style. If the language is python, you must use pytest best practice.

Ensure that your output format follows the following structure:
1. Clean code practices used in the language:
- [Description of clean code practices]
1. Explanation of what the code does from the Code section(Step by Step explanation)
2. Test cases
Case 1: blabla
given input data, bablab
verify blabla
Case 2: blablab
verify blalbla
1. Commands to create folders or files with path.
2. File path and code implementation for each test case above. Code should be in copiable code block.
- FileName1
  [Code Of File]
- FileName2
  [Code Of File]

Code:

Thanks for the newest SourceCodeParser implementation. Now lets move onto 
create the tests for SourceCodeParser.

You should first articulate your thinking process for creating tests instead of jumping to generate the test code directly.

At the end of your thinking process, you will start to provide the test implemenataion.

please writes all tests using pytest style. Please follow pytest best practice, The test naming should use behavior naming style.
