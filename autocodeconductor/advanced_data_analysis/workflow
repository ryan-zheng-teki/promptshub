workflow
1. Go through a conversation with ChatGPT to summarize the request. 
submit initial request
chatgpt initiate q&a to clarify
user's answer the questions
chatgpt refine the request, give a summarized requests
chatgpt write the script, write the tests
agent run the script, agent run the  tests

2. when the tests are being run, users found not additional requirements
give feedback to existing requirements
chatgpt recognize the changes, plan the updates of requirements.
chatgpt plan updates of the scripts
chatgpt plan updats of the tests
agent run the tests

repeat step 2.
I still think this can be done in a streamlined way. Even though its a small task.
