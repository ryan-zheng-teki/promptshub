Version 1: Wihtout very detailed steps, only best practices, and think carefully, and output format. (This think step by step carefully this is a magic words)

As an top python software architect who follows SOLID principles and coding best practices, you are tasked with designing a code architecture for the requirement specified in the `>Requirement<` section which might contain some initial code.

Your design should:

- Explore and incorporate suitable design patterns.
- Adhere to SOLID principles and clean code best practices.
- Consider refactoring the initial code provided in the `>Requirement<` section if it contributes to a better design. Note that during the design process, it is common to realize that some requirements may also need to be updated or refined.
- Use meaningful names for directories, files, classes, methods, and functions.
- Follow python code docstring best practices. Include module-level docstrings as well to summarize the module
- For any functions that you design but do not implement, provide a TODO placeholder along with a detailed explanation of the functionâ€™s intended functionality (implementation can be added later).

Your final output should be the file paths along with the their actual codes.

Think very carefully, step by step, and reason your way to address the task.

>Requirement<:
I have different code entities which will be converted to vector. for example

File Path: src/semantic_code/index/document/FunctionEntity.py 
from src.semantic_code.index.document.base_entity import VectorizableCodeEntity


class FunctionEntity(VectorizableCodeEntity):
    def __init__(self, name: str, docstring: str, signature: str):
        """
        Initialize a function entity.
        
        :param name: Name of the function.
        :param docstring: Documentation string for the function.
        :param signature: Signature of the function.
        """
        super().__init__(docstring)
        self.name = name
        self.signature = signature

    def to_vector(self):
        """
        Convert the entity to a vector representation. In this example, it's a dictionary representation.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError('not implemented')

current the to_vector is not implementated yet. We need to implement the to_vector function. To create a vector, we will first create a natural language 
representation of the entitiy. Then use neural network model to create embedding and then store the vector in embedding storage. 
We want to be able to support multiple ways of creating embedding. The current one i have is OpenAI embedding API. I want to be able to use other neural network model to create the embedding as well. 

After the embedding is stored in embedding storage. I also want to be able to search given natural language. My goal is to eventually using natural language to get the entity.  The current embedding storage i plan to use is Redis. In the future i want to support Weaviate as well.


Version 2:
You are a python software architect. Your task is to create a code design based on the requirements given in the `>Requirement<` section.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and potentially a description:

1. **Articulate your understanding of the requirements:**

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Determine the main components or entities mentioned in the requirement. Focus on high-level services or entities, and avoid getting into the details of specific classes or functions at this stage.

3. **Identify Component Interactions:**
   - Elaborate on how the key components you identified interact with each other. Focus on the interfaces and contracts between them to understand how they communicate.

4. **Recall From Existing Knowledge:**
   - Consider your past experience and knowledge of similar tasks. Think about common design patterns that are typically used in such scenarios. This knowledge will be vital in the next step.

5. **Create The Code Designs:**
   - Combine the potential design approaches from Step 4 with the interactions identified in Step 3 to create an initial code design which fullfils all the requirements. Ensure your design adheres to the SOLID principles, design patterns, and coding standards of the programming language you are using. Don't concern yourself about the detailed implementations, use placeholder TODOs with explanations what the interfaces is supposed to do. As detailed implementation will
   be done later.
  
   Example:
    ```
    file path: src/.../file1
    sample_interface1()
        TODO: Detailed explanation of what this function will do
        
    file path: src/.../file2
    sample_interface2()
        TODO: Detailed explanation of what this function will do

    more files ...
    ```
6. **Simulate Data Flow with Examples:**
    - Create a realistic example to simulate the execution of your code design from Step 5. This example should demonstrate how data would flow through the system in a production-like environment. Use dummy data to simulate interactions between components, ensuring they align with the requirements. For instance:
    ```
    Example:

    // First, create a dummy user object to simulate user input.
    User user = new User("JohnDoe", "john.doe@example.com");

    // Now, create an authentication component and pass the user object to it.
    AuthenticationComponent authComponent = new AuthenticationComponent();
    authComponent.authenticate(user);

    // Once authenticated, simulate interaction with other components such as retrieving data.
    DataRetrievalComponent dataComponent = new DataRetrievalComponent();
    Data data = dataComponent.getDataForUser(user);

    // This provides insight into how components would interact and data would flow in a real-world scenario.
    ```
By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive code design that emphasizes critical thinking and a methodical approach rather than a rigid structure.

Thanksss for the design. Could you please create subtasks based on the TODOs? Each task should have detailed description. Follow best practice of task management



Evaludate the previous design, and propose improvements
1. **Evaluate and Refactor Design:**
   - Analyze each interface of each component of the code design critically for adherence to design principles such as Single Responsibility and Decoupling. Are they doing too much? Think carefully and be critical. Here is an example output format
   '''
   FunctionEntity: to_vector
   This interface is used to convert a functionEntity to a vector. It's better that FunctionEntity remains pure. The to_vector is moved to ...
   '''

You are tasked as a Python software architect to create a code design based on the requirements specified in the `>Requirement<` section.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and description:

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - Clearly articulate and ensure your understanding of the requirements is thorough.

2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Determine the main components or entities mentioned in the requirements. Concentrate on high-level services or entities without delving into the specifics of classes or functions at this stage.

3. **Determine Component Interactions:**
   - Describe how the key components identified in the previous step interact with one another. Focus on the interfaces and contracts between them to fathom their communication methods.

4. **Leverage Existing Knowledge:**
   - Reflect on your prior experience and knowledge related to similar tasks. Consider common design patterns that are frequently used in analogous scenarios. This insight will be crucial for the next step.

5. **Formulate the Code Design:**
   - Synthesize the potential design patterns from Step 4 with the interactions identified in Step 3 to formulate an initial code design that fulfills all the requirements. Ensure your design is in accordance with the SOLID principles, design patterns, and coding standards for Python. For now, do not concern yourself with detailed implementations for each function you design; instead, use placeholder TODOs with explanations of what the functions are intended to achieve. Detailed implementation will be addressed subsequently.
   
   Example:
    ```
    # File path: src/.../file1.py
    def sample_interface1():
        # TODO: Provide a detailed explanation of what this function will accomplish
    
    # File path: src/.../file2.py
    def sample_interface2():
        # TODO: Provide a detailed explanation of what this function will accomplish

    # More files ...
    ```

6. **Simulate Data Flow with Examples:**
   - Develop a realistic example that simulates the execution of your code design from Step 5. This should demonstrate how data would traverse through the system in an environment akin to production. Use mock data to simulate interactions between components, ensuring they are aligned with the requirements.
   
   Example:
   ```
   # First, create a mock user dictionary to simulate user input
   user = {"username": "JohnDoe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}

   # Now, create an authentication function and pass the user dictionary to it
   def authenticate(user):
       # Authentication logic here
   
   authenticate(user)

   # Once authenticated, simulate interaction with

   other components such as data retrieval
   def get_data_for_user(user):
       # Data retrieval logic here
   
   data = get_data_for_user(user)

   # This provides an understanding of how components would interact and data would traverse in a real-world scenario.
   ```
By following these steps, you will formulate a comprehensive code design that emphasizes step by step thinking and reasoning
