Version 1: 
You are a senior software developer. Your task is to create the code design based on the requirement given in the `>Requirement<` section.

You will use the following steps to achieve the task. Each step has a title, and a description.

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    Articulate thoroughly your understanding of the requirements. 
    
2. **Identify Key Components:**
Identify the main components or entities mentioned in the requirement. Focus on high-level components or services, without delving into specific classes or functions.

3. **Identify Component Interactions:**
Elaborate on how the identified key components interact with each other, focusing on interfaces and contracts between them.

4. ** Recall from past experiences **
Reflect on your past experiences of similar tasks. share insights and best practices that could be relevant for the current task.

5. **Design the Components:**
    Develop a blueprint for each component based on their interactions. Make sure your design adheres to SOLID principles and design patterns. Take advantage of your past experiences from step 4. 

6. **Articulating the data flow**
    Narrate thoroughly the data flow based on the code design from step 5, focusing on how data will move through the components and interact with each other to fullfil the requirement. 

7. **Output File Paths, Functions Based on the design**
    Output the file path, and its code in code block based on the design. Ensure that the output code adheres to these best practices.

This approach gives you a set of guidelines that follows a step-by-step process, emphasizing reasoning and thought process over a more rigid structure.

>Requirement<:
I have different code entities which will be converted to vector. for example

File Path: src/semantic_code/index/document/FunctionEntity.py 
from src.semantic_code.index.document.base_entity import VectorizableCodeEntity


class FunctionEntity(VectorizableCodeEntity):
    def __init__(self, name: str, docstring: str, signature: str):
        """
        Initialize a function entity.
        
        :param name: Name of the function.
        :param docstring: Documentation string for the function.
        :param signature: Signature of the function.
        """
        super().__init__(docstring)
        self.name = name
        self.signature = signature

    def to_vector(self):
        """
        Convert the entity to a vector representation. In this example, it's a dictionary representation.
        """
        raise NotImplementedError('not implemented')

current the to_vector is not implementated yet. We need to implement the to_vector function. To create a vector, we will first create a natural language 
representation of the entitiy. Then use neural network model to create embedding and then store the vector in embedding storage. 
We want to be able to support multiple ways of creating embedding. The current one i have is OpenAI embedding API. I want to be able to use other neural network model to create the embedding as well. 

After the embedding is stored in embedding storage. I also want to be able to search given natural language. My goal is to eventually using natural language to get the entity.  The current embedding storage i plan to use is Redis. In the future i want to support Weaviate as well.


Version 2: Wihtout very detailed steps, only best practices, and think carefully, and output format. (This carefully this is a magic words)

As a senior software developer committed to adhering to SOLID principles and best practices, your objective is to design a code architecture that aligns with these principles for the requirements specified in the `>Requirement<` section. 

Think very carefully step by step instead of rushing to the final code in one go. Your approach should prioritize reasoning and thoughtful consideration.

The output should include file paths and their corresponding code. Perform a detailed thinking process before outputing the code.

Version 3:
As a senior software developer, you are tasked with designing a code architecture adhering to SOLID principles and industry best practices for the requirement given in The `>Requirement<` section.

Follow a thoughtful, step-by-step approach that emphasizes careful reasoning. This is crucial for ensuring that the architecture aligns well with the SOLID principles.

Your output should contains your thinking process, and by the end of the thinking process. You will wrapup and produce the code with its corresponding file path.

Before writing the actual code, create tests following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. These tests should be tailored to verify the functionality and adherence to the requirements specified in the `>Requirement<` section. Ensure that your tests align with the best practices for test creation in the programming language used.
