You are a senior requirements engineer. An existing requirement is provided in the `[Requirement]` section, marked by the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens. Additionally, a user request will be available in the `[Request]` section. Your task is to refine the given requirement according to the user request.

# Context:
The target users for the resulting requirement document are developers and large language models like ChatGPT. The goal is to provide a comprehensive yet concise description that aids in direct code design and implementation. If no other explicit feature dependencies are stated, use "None" for the feature dependencies.

## Criteria:
- **Effectiveness**: Ensure the requirement is easily translatable into design solutions and code implementations.
- **Clarity & Brevity**: Define each requirement in a straightforward and succinct manner.
- **Wording Accuracy**: Use precise terminology, ensuring correct usage of singular and plural forms.
- **Consistency**: Avoid conflicting details within the documentation.
- **Completeness**: Ensure all functional requirement behaviors are captured.

## Approach:
1. Understand the provided requirement.
2. Evaluate the user's request against the existing requirement. Analyze if the request is already covered. If not, proceed to the next step.
3. Check for ambiguities or unclear aspects in the user's request. If there are any, ask questions to clarify them.
4. Wait for the user's answer to ensure all questions and ambiguities are addressed.
5. Refine the requirement based on the user's clarified request.

## Output Format:
- Format each step with: "Step [number]: [name]". Example:
  Step 1: Analyze the existing requirement

### Prompt Versioning Mechanism for Optimal Communication with Large Language Models

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
With the increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks ranging from coding to generic queries, there's a growing need for a refined communication mechanism. This feature introduces a versioning mechanism for prompts, designed to cater to any entity or component that communicates with LLMs. The primary motivation is to harness the inherent variability in LLM responses based on prompt nuances, allowing flexibility and comparative analysis between different versions to determine the most effective prompt.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
Software Developer, AI System, or any LLM user:
  - Engages with systems, workflows, or interfaces that utilize LLM capabilities.
  - Aspires to contrast LLM responses across different prompt versions to pinpoint the optimal prompt.
  - Desires a streamlined interface to manage, select, and compare various prompt versions.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
Upon interfacing with any component or entity that uses prompts for LLM communication, users can modify a prompt and save it as a distinct version. They can manually set any version as the current effective prompt. A dropdown facilitates switching between versions, enabling them to fetch LLM responses for each. A comparative analysis follows to discern the most suitable prompt.

#### 2. Requirements:

2.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any given time, there can be only one effective prompt for an entity.
   - Users can select any archived version as the current effective prompt, but this will replace the previously set effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component communicating with LLMs has a distinct default prompt, intrinsic to its code.
   - On the entity's inception, if the database lacks prompts specific to that entity, the default prompt initializes the database. This primary prompt is designated as v1 and is set as the immediate effective prompt by default.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - At the commencement of any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt from the database for the concerned entity.
   - If the database lacks a version for an entity, it's initialized using the entity's inherent default prompt.

- **Decoupling Static Prompt Template**:
   - Dynamically derive the prompt content from the database based on the version, or extract it from the entity's default if it's absent in the database.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Allow the creation of a new prompt version for an entity when the existing prompt undergoes alterations.
   - Preserve a maximum of 4 prompt versions for every entity in the database.
   - Enlist all versions within a dropdown for user-centric selection.
   - Introducing a new version that surpasses the 4-version threshold leads to the deletion of the oldest version.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Simplify the transition between diverse prompt versions for execution and procuring LLM feedback.
   - Consider introducing a side-by-side comparison utility in future endeavors, potentially emphasizing variances between chosen versions.

- **Viewing Past Versions**:
   - Enable users to view the content of previous prompt versions for reference.
   - Ensure easy access and navigation to previous versions.

- **Database Management**:
   - Symbolize versions using elementary incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Archive the creation/modification timestamp for every version.

- **User Interface**:
   - Incorporate a dropdown mechanism within the user interface for prompt version selection.
   - Ensure clarity in version differentiation and streamline the comparative analysis trajectory.
