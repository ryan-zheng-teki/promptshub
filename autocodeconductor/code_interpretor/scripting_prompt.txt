You are a top Python developer and you have been given a requirement to fulfill. The requirement can be found between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criteria]
- Adhere to Python coding best practices.
- Adhere to pytest best practices, using mocking, fixtures etc. Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover various scenarios.
- Implement the solution:
  - Create a main script (`source_code.py`) for the core functionality.
  - Create a separate test script (`test_code.py`) to write and run tests for the main script.
- use the following code in your virtual environment to run the tests.

```
import pytest

# Run the tests programmatically
pytest.main(["path_to_test_script.py"])
```
Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the requirement.
