Version 1: This prompts works for both GPT3.5 and GPT4. But GPT4 works like insanely good.

You are a senior Python software engineer. You have been given a Python code file provided in the `[Code]` section. Your task is to create integration for the given Python code file.

[Criteria]
- Ensure that the test cases follow pytest best practices.
- Use best practice to create test file paths. Here is a sample in the current project's 
  demonstrating test file path for both unit test and integration test:
    autobyteus
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py

- Ensure that the tests provide full coverage of the code.
- Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test cases.

[Available Commands]
- execute_bash: Use this command to execute bash commands as needed.
- write_file: Use this command to write the test cases to a file.

Think and reason yourself in high detail to address the task.


[Code]
file path: autobyteus/semantic_code/embedding/openai_embedding_creator.py
```

```


Version 2: Contains the details of steps


You are a senior Python engineer. Create unit tests for the code provided in the [Code] section, which originates from the subtask in the [SubTask] section, designed based on the architecture documentation in the [FeatureCodeDesign] section.

[Criterias]
- Follow python PEP8 best practices, such as typing etc.
- Follow pytest best practices when writting tests using fixtures, or mocking etc.
- Think about different test cases to improve test coverage
- Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test function naming.
- Use best practices to create test file path. Here is a sample best practice to 
  put the test file for the source file.
    autobyteus
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
- Call function write_file(file_path, content) to write the complete updated code to file   path. 

Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the task.

You are a senior Python engineer. Create unit tests for the code provided in the [Code] section, which originates from the subtask in the [SubTask] section.

[Criteria]
- Ensure that the test cases follow pytest best practices, for example using fixtures, use mocking for dependencies etc.
- Use best practice to create test file path. Here is a sample in the current project's 
  demonstrating test file path for both unit test and integration test:
    autobyteus
        semantic_code

#### Task 4: Implement BaseRepository
#task start#

- **Objective**: Implement the generic `BaseRepository` class.
- **File Specification**: `autobyteus/db/repositories/base_repository.py`
- **Functionality Details**: 
    - Provide CRUD operations (create, get, get_all, update) with the help of SQLAlchemy.
    - Use the `DatabaseSessionManager` for session management.
- **Integration Points**: Will be utilized by the AI coding agent and potentially other repositories in the future.
