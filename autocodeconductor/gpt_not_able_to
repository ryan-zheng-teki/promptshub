Actually the knowledge graph from requirement to code is 100% related.
The theory is simple, if they are not related, human will not be able to find it.

Even human is able to find it. Then machine should find it 100 percent. why? Because machine
has even better understanding of language itself. The relevancy between words.

(1) Detailed logic error after refactoring
    Each test case -> test case in code
    Every method method is associated with tests. 

Every update of requirement 
    -> update tests
    -> update the source code. Even change the arguments. function names.
