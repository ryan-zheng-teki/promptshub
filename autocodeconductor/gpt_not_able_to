Actually the knowledge graph from requirement to code is 100% related.
The theory is simple, if they are not related, human will not be able to find it.

(1) Detailed logic error after refactoring
    Each test case -> test case in code
    Every method method is associated with tests. 

Every update of requirement 
    -> update tests
    -> update the source code. Even change the arguments. function names.
