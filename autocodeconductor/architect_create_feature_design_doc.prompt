### Automated Coding Workflow System

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
As software development evolves, the demand for automating coding processes intensifies. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT, there's an opportunity to leverage these models to streamline coding tasks. The Automated Coding Workflow system addresses this by providing a structured and modular approach to manage and execute multi-step coding workflows. This system not only automates the coding process but also seamlessly integrates with LLMs and organizes coding requirements presentation to users.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
Software Developer or Software Architect who needs to:
  - Set up an automated coding workflow.
  - Integrate with Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT.
  - Define and modify steps in the workflow.
  - Execute specific steps or the entire workflow.
  - Receive prompts and provide inputs for specific steps (e.g., requirements).
  - Monitor the status of the workflow.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
A user initializes the Automated Coding Workflow system and integrates it with an LLM like ChatGPT. They then define various steps in the process, starting with a requirement step where they input coding requirements. This could be followed by an architecture design step, outlining the system's design. Each step is modular, allowing users to customize the sequence and add or remove steps as required. As the workflow progresses, the user interacts with prompts, provides necessary inputs, and leverages the power of LLMs in the automation process. They can monitor the workflow status and ensure successful completion.

   - Monitor the status of the workflow (e.g., Started, Success, Failure).
   
- **LLM Integration**:
   - Integrate with Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT.
   - Manage integrations with the LLM system.
   
- **Step Management**:
   - Define a step with unique ID generation.
   - Construct dynamic prompts for each step using a versioning system.
   - Process responses from the LLM API for the steps.
   - Execute the logic associated with each step.
   
- **Requirement Handling**:
   - Present coding requirements to the user.
   - Prompt users with requirements and provide guidelines on addressing them.
   - Capture user input for requirements through prompt variables.
   
- **Architecture Design**:
   - Represent the design stage in the coding workflow.
   - Construct prompts for the design step.

- **Configuration Management**:
   - Define the structure of the automated coding workflow.

### Enhanced Automated Coding Workflow with Versioned Prompts for Comparative Analysis

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
The Automated Coding Workflow, designed to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating coding tasks, requires an upgrade. The inherent variability in LLM responses based on prompt nuances has necessitated versioned prompts for each step. The aim encompasses flexibility and comparative analysis between different versions to determine the most effective prompt.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
Software Developer or AI System:
  - Engages with the Automated Coding Workflow to utilize LLM capabilities.
  - Aspires to contrast LLM responses across different prompt versions to pinpoint the optimal prompt.
  - Desires a streamlined interface to manage, select, and juxtapose various prompt versions.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
Upon interacting with a specific step in the Automated Coding Workflow, a user can modify a prompt and save it as a distinct version. They have the liberty to manually set any version as the current effective prompt. A dropdown facilitates switching between versions, enabling them to fetch LLM responses for each. A comparative analysis follows to discern the most suitable prompt.

#### 2. Requirements:

2.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Step-Specific Default and Effective Prompts**:
   - Every step within the Automated Coding Workflow boasts a distinct default prompt, intrinsic to the step's code.
   - On the step's inception, if the database lacks prompts specific to that step, the default prompt initializes the database. This primary prompt is designated as v1 and is set as the immediate current effective prompt by default.
   - Users retain the autonomy to manually select any archived version as the current effective prompt for a step.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - At the commencement of a step, the system retrieves the current effective prompt from the database.
   - If the database lacks a version for a step, it's initialized using the step's inherent default prompt.

- **Decoupling Static Prompt Template**:
   - Extinguish the static prompt template from `BaseStep`.
   - Dynamically derive the prompt content from the database based on the version or extract it from the step's default if it's absent in the database.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Allow the creation of a new prompt version for a step when the existing prompt undergoes alterations.
   - Preserve a maximum of 4 prompt versions for every step in the database.
   - Enlist all versions within a dropdown for user-centric selection during engagements.
   - Introducing a new version that surpasses the 4-version threshold leads to the irrevocable deletion of the oldest version.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Simplify the transition between diverse prompt versions for execution and procuring LLM feedback.
   - Ponder over introducing a side-by-side comparison utility in future endeavors, potentially with an emphasis on highlighting variances between chosen versions.

- **Viewing Past Versions**:
   - Empower users to peruse the content of bygone prompt versions for reference.
   - Guarantee facile access and intuitive traversal to previous versions.

- **Database Management**:
   - Symbolize versions using elementary incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Archive the creation/modification timestamp for every version.

- **User Interface**:
   - Infuse a dropdown mechanism within the user interface to champion prompt version selection.
   - Accentuate clarity in version differentiation and expedite the comparative analysis trajectory.



[ExistingFeatureCodeDesign]
### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The enhancement integrates a versioning mechanism for prompts used in each workflow step. By introducing the `PromptVersioningMixin`, the original `BaseStep` structure and workflow remain largely unaffected. However, they now acquire versioning functionalities that store, manage, and refine versioned prompts in a database. The Repository Pattern from previous features is leveraged for database interactions.

#### 2. Component Modifications:

2.1. **New Components**:

- **PromptVersioningMixin**: 
  - *Purpose*: A mixin class offering versioning capabilities with integrated database interactions.
  - *Attributes*: 
    - `current_effective_version: int`: Represents the version number of the current effective prompt.
    - `default_prompt: str`: The default prompt intrinsic to the step's code.
  - *Methods*: 
    - `add_version(prompt: str)`: Creates and stores a new version of the prompt. If the number of versions surpasses the limit (4), it deletes the oldest version.
    - `get_version(version_no: int)`: Retrieves the content of a specified prompt version.
    - `set_current_effective_version(version_no: int)`: Sets a specific version as the current effective prompt.
    - `get_current_effective_version()`: Fetches the content of the current effective prompt.
    - `load_latest_version()`: Retrieves the content of the latest created prompt version.

- **VersionedPrompt**:
  - *Purpose*: Represents the state of a prompt at a particular version in-memory.
  - *Attributes*: 
    - `version_no: int`: The version number.
    - `prompt_content: str`: The content of the prompt for that version.

- **PromptVersionModel (extends BaseModel)**:
  - *Purpose*: Represents the database model for storing versioned prompts.
  - *Attributes*: 
    - `step_id: String`: Identifier for the step.
    - `version_no: Integer`: Version number.
    - `prompt_content: Text`: Content of the prompt.
    - `is_current_effective: Boolean`: Indicates if this version is the current effective prompt.
    - `created_at: DateTime`: Timestamp for creation/modification.

- **PromptVersionRepository (extends BaseRepository)**:
  - *Purpose*: Offers CRUD operations for `PromptVersionModel` and manages version-specific operations.
  - *Methods*: 
    - `create_version(prompt_version: PromptVersionModel)`: Stores a new prompt version.
    - `get_version(step_id: String, version_no: int)`: Fetches a specific version of a prompt.
    - `get_current_effective_version(step_id: String)`: Retrieves the current effective prompt for a step.
    - `get_latest_created_version(step_id: String)`: Retrieves the most recently created prompt version.
    - `delete_version(step_id: String, version_no: int)`: Deletes a specific version.
    - `delete_oldest_version(step_id: String)`: Deletes the oldest version when the limit is surpassed.

2.2. **Updated Components**:

- **BaseStep**:
  - *Modification*: Extend from `PromptVersioningMixin`.
  - *Purpose*: Inherits versioning capabilities with database integration. The static prompt template from `BaseStep` is removed, and prompts are dynamically derived based on the version.

2.3. **Unchanged Components**:

- **BaseModel**: 
  - *Description*: The foundational model class for database entities.
  
- **BaseRepository**: 
  - *Description*: Provides generic CRUD operations.

#### 3. Interactions:

3.1. **Component Interactions**:

- Steps augmented with `PromptVersioningMixin` will possess versioning capabilities with database operations.
- `PromptVersioningMixin` will interface with `PromptVersionRepository` for database interactions.

#### 4. External Dependencies: 

- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM tool facilitating database operations.
- **Alembic**: For database migration and versioning.
