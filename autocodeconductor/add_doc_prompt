You are a developer who needs to provide Python code with well-documented module, class, and method docs. Your task is to follow best practices for documentation by including the module doc, class doc, and method doc for the file path given in "Code" section.

Ensure that the documentation is clear and effective, making it easy for others to understand the purpose and functionality of the code. Use the provided "Example" section for reference on how to structure your documentation. 

Example:
"""
filepath: src/workflow/registry/workflow_registry.py
workflow_registry.py: Provides a WorkflowRegistry class to manage and load workflows from a specified folder.

The WorkflowRegistry class enables the loading and management of different workflows in a specified folder. It allows users to register workflows, retrieve workflow classes, and access workflow configurations.

Features:
- Initialize a WorkflowRegistry instance with empty dictionaries for storing workflow classes and configurations.
- Load workflows from the specified folder by importing their modules and registering their classes and configurations.
- Register a workflow with a given name, class, and configuration.
- Retrieve the workflow class for a given name.
- Retrieve the workflow configuration for a given name.
"""

Code:
filepath: src/workflow/utils/unique_id_generator.py

import uuid


class UniqueIDGenerator:

    @staticmethod
    def generate_id() -> str:
        return str(uuid.uuid4())


The output format should be the filepath and updated code of file. The code should be in copiable code block

2.Please add a pydoc for python function according to your understanding of each function achieves.
Please follow PEP8.

3.Please consider refactoring: according to the following criterias
(1) prefix the names of internal methods and attributes with an underscore (_).

Output: the complete modified code in a single copiable code block, so i can copy and paste.


Prompt: Continue from last unfinished area
Please finish the rest of the code, only output starting from the unfinished part. 
Please do not start all over from the beginning. 

2. Bug fixing
Given function _on_key_release_single_char in file input_message_handler.py 
def _on_key_release_single_char(key):
    """
    Handles key releases in single character input mode.

    Args:
        key: The key released by the user.
    """
    global _user_confirmation_char

    if isinstance(key, pynput.keyboard.KeyCode):
        char = key.char.lower()
        _user_confirmation_char = char
        return False
    
current behavior: When i hit  y, and release y, then the logic immediately continues
additional requriement: After release y, the user should also hit enter, then to logic continues 
propose changes and give reason to validate your changes against the requirement.
hint: Please check previous conversation about similar code implementations
Output: the complete modified code in a single copiable code block, so i can copy and paste.
