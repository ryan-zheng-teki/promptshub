You are a Python software architect tasked with creating subtasks based on provided feature requirements and code design documentation found in the [Documentation] section. Use the format detailed in the `[Template]` section. Ensure that your subtasks follow a logical order, with dependencies placed appropriately.  The goal is when each subtask is implemented with following the order, we will get completely working feature. 

### Approach
1. Understand the feature requirements thoroughly
2. Understand the feature code design thoroughly, pay attention to the components which are labeled as 'New'.
3. Reason about the subtasks to be created, and their dependencies order. 
   the subtasks will include setups, for example install libraries, create folders etc.
4. Present the subtasks under section [SubTasks].

### Automated Coding Workflow

#### 1. Story/Feature Description:

1.1. **Background**: 
With the advent of advanced AI and large language models (LLMs), there's a growing need to harness their power for automated coding tasks. The Automated Coding Workflow serves as a structured interface to interact with LLMs. This modular, step-by-step approach simplifies and streamlines the process of utilizing the capabilities of LLMs for coding tasks by breaking down the process into distinct phases.

1.2. **User Persona**: 
Software Developer or AI System:
  - Looking to automate certain coding tasks using LLMs.
  - Desires a structured approach to interact with LLMs for coding tasks.
  - Requires flexibility to execute specific steps and serialize the workflow.

1.3. **User Journey**: 
A developer or system initializes the Automated Coding Workflow. They provide specific inputs at various stages, such as requirements, design, implementation, and testing. The workflow dispatches these inputs as prompts to the LLM. The LLM processes these prompts and returns appropriate outputs, guiding the developer or system through each phase. The user has the flexibility to serialize the workflow, execute specific steps, and monitor the status of the workflow.

#### 2. Requirements:

2.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the automated coding workflow using specific configurations.
   - Support for multi-layered steps and sub-steps.

- **Workflow Management**:
   - Serialize the entire workflow to JSON format.
   - Execute specific steps in the workflow as needed.
   - Track and manage different states of the workflow.

- **Interaction with LLM**:
   - Dispatch uniquely configured prompts to the LLM for processing.
   - Receive and handle responses from the LLM.

- **Steps in Workflow**:
   - **RequirementStep**:
     - Accept and process coding requirements.
     - Construct a unique prompt for the LLM based on the requirements.
   - **ArchitectureDesignStep**:
     - Manage the architectural design phase.
     - Construct a unique prompt for the LLM based on design needs.
   - **ImplementationStep**:
     - Oversee the coding implementation phase.
     - Construct a unique prompt for the LLM based on implementation details.
   - **TestGenerationStep**:
     - Generate tests for Python code.
     - Construct a unique prompt for the LLM based on the code to generate tests.

### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The feature orchestrates an automated coding workflow, modularly structured, where each individual step, derived from a `BaseStep`, represents a distinct phase in the workflow. One of the pivotal aspects of the design is that every step employs its own uniquely configured prompt, which is dispatched to a large language model (LLM) for processing. The workflow allows for serialization to JSON, and specific steps can be executed as needed. The design is enhanced with support for multi-layered steps and sub-steps.

1.2. **New Components**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow (New)**: Manages the automated coding workflow. It is in charge of initializing steps, running specific steps, and serializing the workflow to JSON.
- **WORKFLOW_CONFIG (New)**: Offers configuration specifics for the entire workflow.
- **BaseStep (New)**: Serves as a foundational class for workflow steps. Every distinct step derives from this class and has its own prompt configuration for communication with the LLM.
- **WorkflowStatus (New)**: An enumeration potentially representing different states of the workflow.
- **StepsTemplateConfig (New)**: Configuration parameters for individual steps.
- **RequirementStep (New)**: Processes requirements using its own tailored prompt template.
- **ArchitectureDesignStep (New)**: Handles the architectural design phase with its unique prompt.
- **ImplementationStep (New)**: Oversees the coding implementation phase with its distinct prompt.
- **TestGenerationStep (New)**: Dedicated to generating tests for Python code, equipped with a detailed prompt.

1.3. **Existing Components/Dependencies**:
- **LLMIntegrationRegistry (Existing)**: From the `llm_integrations` package, it manages integrations pertinent to LLM.
- **WorkspaceSetting (Existing)**: Originating from the `workspaces` package, it holds workspace-specific settings.
- **PromptTemplate (Existing)**: From the `prompt` package, it's a template structure for constructing prompts.
- **PromptTemplateVariable (Existing)**: Also from the `prompt` package, it defines variables to be embedded in prompt templates.

1.4. **Interactions**: 
- The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` initializes steps using the `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`.
- Every step, like `RequirementStep` or `ArchitectureDesignStep`, constructs a unique prompt using `PromptTemplate` and `PromptTemplateVariable`.
- The workflow status might be tracked and set using the `WorkflowStatus`.
- Steps may need to interact with the `LLMIntegrationRegistry` for integration management during execution.
- During initialization, the `WorkspaceSetting` is passed to the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow`.

1.5. **External Dependencies**: 
No third-party libraries, services, or tools have been identified from the provided code segments.

[SubTasks]
here place the result subtasks created.



Version 2: Version 2 is running in the same session, chatgpt still has access to 
the design documentation.

Thanks. Now let's move on to create subtasks based on  code design documentation. Use the format detailed in the `[Template]` section. Ensure that your subtasks follow a logical order, with dependencies resolved appropriately. The goal is when each subtask is implemented with defined order, we will get completely working code for the feature. 

### Approach
2. Understand the feature code design thoroughly, pay attention to the components which are labeled as 'New'.
2. Reason about the subtasks to be created, and their dependencies order. Note: the subtasks 
not only include implementation subtasks, but also include setups for example, creating folders, install libraries etc.
3. Present the subtasks under section [SubTasks].


Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. Follow the format in the `[Template]` section and Ensure that your subtasks follow a logical order, with dependencies resolved appropriately. When executed in the given order, the subtasks should lead to a fully functional code implementation for the specified feature.

### Approach
1. Thoroughly understand the feature's code design, focusing on components labeled as 'New'.
2. Identify the subtasks required, considering their execution order and dependencies. Remember, subtasks can include both implementation steps and setup processes.
Start with the primary setup subtask: such as installing necessary libraries, creating directories, or creating essential files etc. Refer to current project structure in 'ProjectFolderStructure' section. This ensures a correctly set up environment for all subsequent tasks. After this, list the other necessary subtasks, considering their execution order and interdependencies.
3. Present the identified subtasks under the [SubTasks] section.

### ProjectFolderStructure
    src
    tests
        unit_tests
        integration_tests
    requirements.txt


Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section. Additionally, ensure that your subtasks are arranged logically, addressing any dependencies. Executing these subtasks in order should result in a complete and functioning code implementation of the mentioned feature.

### Approach:
1. Familiarize yourself with the feature's code design, especially components marked as 'New'.
2. Determine the necessary subtasks. Start with foundational tasks like installing relevant libraries, setting up directories, or creating essential files. Follow python best practice to naming files and folders. Use the 'ProjectFolderStructure' section as a reference. After the setup, list all other subtasks in order of execution, considering their dependencies.
3. List the finalized subtasks in the [SubTasks] section.

### ProjectFolderStructure

Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section.

### Approach 
1. Think and reason the neccessary subtasks in order to have a complete running feature.
Here subtask does not need to be detailed. And think about their dependencies.
2. Answer the following questions and give why:
   Any new libraries to install? Any new folders or files to create? If yes, think about good naming for these folders and files. Follow python best practice to naming files and folders. Use the current 'ProjectFolderStructure' section as a reference.
3. Based on the thinking and reasoning until so far, now formalize the creation of subtasks.
   Start with foundational tasks like installing relevant libraries, setting up directories, or creating essential files. After the setup, list all other subtasks in order of execution, considering their dependencies.

Thank you. Now let's move on to creating subtasks based on code design documentation. These subtasks should follow the structure provided in the `[Template]` section.

### Approach 
1. **Think and Reason about Necessary Subtasks**:
    - Outline neccessary subtasks to achieve a complete feature. Remember, details can be minimal initially; focus on understanding the sequence and dependencies.
2. **Answer Preliminary Questions and give why**:
    - Any new libraries to install? 
    - Any new folders or files to create? If yes, Follow good python naming practices for these folders and files. Use the current 'ProjectFolderStructure' section as a guide.
3. **Formalize the Creation of Subtasks based on Step 1 and Step 2**:
    -  Begin with initial task. It installs relevant libraries, setting up the required directories, and creating all essential files for all the other subtasks.
    - List all other subtasks in the order of their dependencies.
