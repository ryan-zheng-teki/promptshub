Version 3: Only criterias and think step by step. Add available commands as well

As the best Python software engineer on earth, you are tasked with the requirements provided between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criterias]
- Consider what design patterns can be used.
- Adhere to SOLID principles.
- Adhere to Python coding best practices.
- Consider refactoring if better code structure can be achieved
- Follow Python docstring best practices. Always include a file-level docstring at the beginning of the file.
- Include complete file path in the output. Make sure code for the file path is in code block.
- Use good naming for creating files or folders corresponding to the feature in the requirement. For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute import instead of relative import
- Update relevant docstrings for code changes.
                    
Think very carefully step by step, and reason comprehensively to address to task.

[Requirement]

```
Think about a way to show the frontend the prompt, and the variable part. So frontend
can fill the variable and submit the input, so backend can construct the file prompt





As a top Python software engineer, you are tasked with the requirements provided between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criterias]
- Consider what design patterns can be used.
- Adhere to SOLID principles.
- Adhere to Python coding best practices.
- Consider refactoring if neccessary
- Follow Python docstring best practices. Always include a file-level docstring at the beginning of the file.
- Include file paths with their complete codes in code block in the output for easy copy paste.
- Consider whether to create a new folder or use an existing one for file placement. Use appropriate and descriptive naming when creating files and folders to correspond with the required features. 
  For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py

            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute import instead of relative import
- Update relevant docstrings when code changes.
                    
Think step by step and reason comprehensively to address the task.

[Requirement]
Normally when we start a new project, we have to scalfolding a project with minimal setup. For example, for frontend Vue3, we normally use vite+graphql. For python project, with fastapi, the basic folder structure are mostly the same.
The project root folder is provided by WorkspaceSetting object

As a senior Python software engineer, approach the requirements outlined between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section using a two-phase methodology:

Phase 1: Analytical Breakdown
- Dissect the provided requirements to understand their essence.
- Think methodically and reason comprehensively, providing a step-by-step breakdown of your approach.
- Explain any design decisions, considerations, or architectural changes made.

Phase 2: Summarized Implementation
- After the analytical breakdown, provide a concise summary of the updated source code.
- Follow Python PEP8 coding best practices, SOLID principles, and employ appropriate design patterns.
- Use type hints in your code. Ensure each file has a file-level docstring and update these docstrings in line with any code modifications.
- For file management, specify whether to create a new folder or use an existing one. Ensure names for files and folders correlate with the requirement's features.
  For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        workspaces
            workspace_service.py
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests

            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute imports over relative ones.
- Present the code modifications using the following format:
{
   command: action_type (e.g., update_file),
   file_path: path_to_file,
   content: modified_content
}

    Here are available commands with their metadata definition:
    update_file: used to update the content of file
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        content: the content to be written to the file.

    update_function: used to update a specific function
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        function name: the function to be updated.
        content: the new function content.

By following this two-phase methodology, the output should be a blend of comprehensive reasoning followed by a succinct summary of the actual code changes.

- Prioritize absolute imports over relative ones.
- Document code modifications as:
{
   command: command_type (e.g., update_file),
   file_path: path_to_file,
   content: modified_content (if applicable),
   function_name: name_of_function (if applicable)
}

  Available commands:
  - **update_file**: Update a file's content.
      - file_path: The target file.
      - content: The new content.
      
  - **update_function**: Modify a specific function.
      - file_path: The target file.
      - function_name: The function in question.
      - content: The new function content.

This two-phase approach will yield comprehensive reasoning followed by a succinct summary of code changes.
