As a software developer tasked with modifying and updating a given piece of code in the `>>Code<<` section according to the requirement given in the `>>Requirement<<` section. The content of both sections starts with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Please follow the steps below. Each step has a title and a description of the step.

1. Understand the Requirements in the `>>Requirement<<` Section:
   - Articulate your understanding of the provided requirements

2. Understand given code in the  `>>Code<<` section:
   - Explain step by step what the code does.
   - And Articulate your reasoning in detail how the provided code aligns or diverges from the provided requirements. 

3. Reasoning About changes to fullfil requirements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on code changes that can fullfil the requirements. Explain why these changes are necessary and how they solve the requirement

4. Present the First Version of the Modified Code:
   - present the first version of the modified code based on step 3.

5. Share Your Knowledge of Clean Code in the identified Language:
   - Discuss SOLID principles and clean code best practices for the identified programming language. 
   - Articulate narratively how these principles and practices can be applied to the code. If no improvements need to be made jump to step 7. If there are improvements ideas, then jump to step 6.

6. Refine the First Version of updated code:
   - Based on the refactoring ideas from step 5, output the improved code. Don't forget correct import if you are introduced new libraries in the updated code. The use following output format 
   - file path: src/.../file 1
     content: 
     [ code of the file]
   - file path: src/.../file 1
     [ code of the file]

7. Mentally test the Modified Code:
   - Articulate your mental step-by-step test of the modified code to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce new issues.

Version 2: This version is simplified. Only with best practice, and output requirement.
With one additional statement: think very carefully step by step. 
As a software developer tasked with modifying and updating a given piece of code in the `>>Code<<` section according to the requirement given in the `>>Requirement<<` section. The content of both sections starts with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

You will think very carefully step by step. You output should contain your thinking process. After the thinking process, output the updated code with file path. Use the following format for output:

## Thinking
- here is the detailed thinking process
## Code 
 # file path: src/.../file1 
 # content:
   [ content of the ]
