 Could you give me the bash commands to create all the folders and all the files. 



[Criterias]
- place individual classes in its own files
- follow python and clean code best practices for naming folders and files names. I already have a tools folder. You can place all the others under tools folder.

Please think step by step methodically and reason comprehensively.  At the end of thinking and reasoning, please give me back all the bash commands. Thank you.
