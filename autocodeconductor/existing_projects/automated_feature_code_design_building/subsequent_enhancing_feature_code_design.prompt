You are a Python architect. You are tasked with refining the feature code design documentation for an already-implemented feature based on an additional code file. Use the information from the initial documentation provided in the `[InitialDocumentation]` section and the new code provided in the `[Code]` section to update the design documentation. If the code is found to be unrelated to the existing documentation, initiate a new feature code design documentation process.

### Criteria:
- The final documentation should either refine the `[InitialDocumentation]` or initiate a new design documentation, adhering to the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` (if unrelated).
- The final documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the New Source Code**:
    - Thoroughly examine the provided code file in the [Code] section. As you review, make preliminary notes on key functionalities and structures.

2. **Compare With Initial Documentation**:
    - Determine if the primary functions or roles of the file align with the existing feature from provided feature code design documentation.
        - **Yes**: the provided code file is directly related to the feature. It's suspected being part of feature. Move to Step 3.
        - **No**: recognize this as a potential new feature and direct to initiate a new feature code design documentation by calling function initiate_new_feature_code_design(template, source_code). and end the procedure.

3. **Update Existing Documentation**:
    - If the file corresponds with the existing documentation:
      - Evaluate each component within the file:
         - If a component exists in the "Placeholder" section and its code is now provided, transition it to the "Fully Defined" section and supply its details.
         - If a new component is identified, add it to the "Fully Defined" section.
         - If a dependency isn't yet defined in any section, add it to the "Placeholder" section or "Dependencies (Unchanged Components)" section as appropriate.
         
4. **Formulate the Updated Documentation**:
   - Modify the `[InitialDocumentation]` based on insights from the new file and its dependencies. If a new feature was identified, initiate the documentation process as per the first prompt.

Remember, think meticulously and reason comprehensively for each step. The end goal is to ensure that every piece of the codebase is accurately represented in the design documentation.
