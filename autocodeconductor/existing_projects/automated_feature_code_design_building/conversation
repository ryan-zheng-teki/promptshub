Splitting the prompt into two can make sense, especially if you want to modularize the process and make the decision-making more explicit. One prompt can handle the decision-making (the scheduler), and the other two prompts can handle the specific actions (update or initiate new documentation).

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Scheduler Prompt**:
    - The purpose of this prompt is to compare the `[Code]` with the `[InitialDocumentation]` and decide whether to update the existing documentation or initiate a new one.

2. **Update Existing Documentation Prompt**:
    - This will be responsible for updating the existing documentation based on the new code.

3. **Initiate New Documentation Prompt**:
    - This will start the process of creating a new feature code design documentation.

**Scheduler Prompt**:
```
You are a Python architect. Decide if the new code provided in the `[Code]` section matches the `[InitialDocumentation]` or if it introduces a new feature.

If the `[Code]` aligns with the `[InitialDocumentation]`, proceed with updating the existing documentation.
If not, initiate a new feature code design documentation process.

### Criteria:
- Does the primary functionality of the `[Code]` match the `[InitialDocumentation]`?
    - **Yes**: Call `update_existing_documentation(initial_doc, code)`.
    - **No**: Call `initiate_new_feature_code_design(template, source_code)`.
```

**Update Existing Documentation Prompt**:
```
You are tasked with refining the feature code design documentation based on the provided `[Code]` and `[InitialDocumentation]`.

### Procedure:
1. **Examine the New Source Code**:
   - Review the `[Code]` and note key functionalities and structures.

2. **Update Existing Documentation**:
   - Move components in the "Placeholder" with available code to the "Fully Defined" section and provide details.
   - Add any new component discovered to the "Fully Defined" section.
   - If an undefined dependency is found, place it in the "Placeholder" or "Dependencies (Unchanged Components)" section.

3. **Finalize the Documentation**:
   - Adjust the `[InitialDocumentation]` based on the `[Code]` and its dependencies.

The goal is to ensure every part of the codebase is accurately represented in the design documentation.
```

**Initiate New Documentation Prompt**:
```
You are tasked with initiating a new feature code design documentation based on the provided `[Code]`.

### Procedure:
1. **Examine the New Source Code**:
   - Study the `[Code]` and identify key functionalities and structures.

2. **Initiate New Documentation**:
   - Start the documentation process using the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template`.
   - Define each component and functionality from the `[Code]` and place them in the appropriate sections of the template.

The goal is to accurately document the new feature introduced by the provided codebase.
```

By modularizing the prompts, it provides clearer and more direct instructions for each specific task. This can also improve scalability and maintainability if you need to refine or expand each module in the future.
