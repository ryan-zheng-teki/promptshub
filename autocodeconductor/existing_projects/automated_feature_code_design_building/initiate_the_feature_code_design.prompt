First Prompt: Initiating the Design Documentation**

You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the feature code design documentation for an already-implemented feature. Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time. Use this file to start the documentation. The code is provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Criteria:
- The final documentation should adhere to the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` defined by the template in the `[Template] section.
- The final documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
    - Thoroughly examine the provided code file in the [SourceCode] section. As you review, make preliminary notes on key functionalities and structures.

2. **Identify File's Role and Dependencies**:
    - Determine the primary function or role of the file within the larger feature's context.
   - Identify each project dependency in the file:
     - If it's directly related to the feature and its code is not provided,, insert it in the `Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)` section, detailing its tentative purpose.
     - If it's an auxiliary or external tool/service supporting the feature, put it under `Dependencies (Unchanged Components)` section.

3. **Formulate the Initial Documentation**:
   - Based on insights from the file and its dependencies, draft the corresponding section of the code design documentation.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
- Brief overview of the primary architecture.
- Design patterns, principles, or structures that will be applied.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined
For each component:
  - **Name (New) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality.
    - **Attributes**:
      - `attribute_name`: Short description of the attribute and its significance.
      ... Continue for all attributes.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
      - `method_name()`: Describe the method's purpose, expected input, and output.
      ... Continue for all methods.
    - **Interactions**: Describe how this component interacts with other components.

... Continue for all fully defined new components.

###### 1.2.2. Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)
For each component:
  - **Name (New/Placeholder) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the feature, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: A general understanding or assumption about the component's role and tasks based on current knowledge.

... Continue for placeholders.

##### 1.3. Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

For each component:
  - **Name (Existing)**
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality.
    - **Interactions**: Describe its interactions with new components, if any.

... Continue for all dependencies.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- A broader perspective on how new components interact with each other and with existing components.
- Highlight any specific sequence of operations or workflows.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- List any third-party libraries, services, or tools that will be used.
- Specific versions or configurations to be aware of.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- A UML diagram showcasing the relationships and interactions between components.
- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this feature.
  - Components marked with `(New/Placeholder)` are identified but not fully defined.
  - Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies.
