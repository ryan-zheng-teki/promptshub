You are a Python software architect. Your objective is to enhance the existing Feature Code Design Documentation in the `[ExistingDocumentation]` section based on the Python source code presented in the `[SourceCode]` section. This enhancement is necessary because we're incrementally creating code design documentation for our existing codebase, and the current documentation does not fully represent the existing code for the feature.

Criteria:
- Adhere to the format provided in the `[Template]` section.
- Present the final complete documentation to facilitate easy copy and paste.

Think step by step to address task meticulously.

[Template]
### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
Provide a brief overview of the primary architecture and any applied design patterns.

1.2. **Component Descriptions**:
- **Component1**: Detail its role and functionality.
- **Component2**: Outline its role and functionality.
... Continue as needed.

1.3. **Interactions**: 
Describe the interactions and flow between the different components.

1.4. **External Dependencies**: 
List any third-party libraries, services, or tools used.

#### 2. UML Diagram:
Offer a UML representation that highlights the system components and their relationships.

### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The code revolves around the `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` class which represents a fully automated coding workflow. This workflow comprises multiple steps, with each step being represented as an instance of a class derived from `BaseStep`. Each step can further have sub-steps, allowing for a potentially multi-level workflow.

1.2. **Component Descriptions**:
- **AutomatedCodingWorkflow**: This is the primary class representing the complete automated coding process. It initializes the workflow, manages step executions, and provides functionality to convert the workflow to a JSON format.
  - Attributes:
    - `workspace_setting`: Holds the settings related to the workspace.
    - `steps`: Contains a dictionary of step instances, each keyed by their step IDs.
    - `name`: Name of the workflow.
    - `config`: Configuration details loaded from `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`.
  - Methods:
    - `_initialize_steps`: A private method to initialize workflow steps from a given configuration. This method also handles the initialization of sub-steps recursively.
    - `to_json`: Converts the workflow instance to a JSON format.
    - `execute_step`: Executes a specific step within the workflow.
    - `start_workflow`: Sets the workflow's status to Started.

- **LLMIntegrationRegistry**: Though not detailed in the provided code, it seems to be a registry for integrations related to LLM.

- **BaseStep**: Represents a base step in the workflow. Specific details are not provided, but it's inferred that derived classes represent specific steps in the coding workflow and have an `execute` method.

- **WorkspaceSetting**: Contains settings associated with the workspace, but specific details are not provided in the code.

1.3. **Interactions**: 
The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` initializes using a workspace setting. During initialization, it sets up its steps (and potentially sub-steps) based on the provided `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`. Steps can be executed individually using the `execute_step` method, and the entire workflow can be converted to a JSON representation using the `to_json` method.

1.4. **External Dependencies**: 
The code utilizes several modules and classes, such as:
- `json`: For converting the workflow representation to JSON format.
- `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`: Provides configuration details for the workflow.
- `LLMIntegrationRegistry`: Likely a registry for integrations related to LLM.
- `BaseStep`: Represents the base class for steps in the workflow.
- `WorkflowStatus`: Represents different status values the workflow can be in. Specific details are not provided.
- `StepsTemplateConfig`: Provides the configuration template for workflow steps. Specific details are not provided.
- `WorkspaceSetting`: Contains settings for the workspace.

        + to_json(): str
        + execute_step(step_id: str): Optional[str]
        + start_workflow()
    }
    
    note top of AutomatedCodingWorkflow
        Represents the main automated coding workflow.
        It handles initialization, execution of steps, and conversion to JSON.
    end note
    
    AutomatedCodingWorkflow --> BaseStep: Has multiple step instances
    AutomatedCodingWorkflow --> WorkspaceSetting: Utilizes workspace settings
    AutomatedCodingWorkflow --> LLMIntegrationRegistry: Maintains a registry instance
