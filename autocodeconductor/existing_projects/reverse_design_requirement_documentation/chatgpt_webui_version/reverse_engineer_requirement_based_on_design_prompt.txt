The `execute_step` method allows for the execution of individual steps by their IDs, while the `start_workflow` method is intended to start the entire workflow process.

The `BaseStep` provides foundational methods and attributes required for individual steps in the workflow. It uses versioning capabilities from `PromptVersioningMixin` and constructs prompts possibly using `PromptTemplate`.
