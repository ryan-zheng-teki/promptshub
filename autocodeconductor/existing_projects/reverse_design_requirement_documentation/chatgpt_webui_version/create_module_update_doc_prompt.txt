Conversation:
In software engineering, each feature comes with its corresponding feature requirement documentation. As development progresses, features may integrate functionalities from others. It's crucial that the documentation of a feature like Feature A remains updated, especially if it integrates functionality from Feature B. There's a proposal to introduce a "Feature Update" documentation for capturing such changes. However, detailing the interplay between features can be challenging due to the high-level nature of requirement documents. To ensure clarity, it's proposed that each feature's title be abbreviated by using the first letter of each word, creating a unique short name for easy referencing. This would help in clearly defining the boundaries and dependencies between features in the documentation.


We aim to integrate the "Plan Of Change documentation" from Feature A with its initial requirements. Doing so will result in an updated requirements document that aligns seamlessly with the codebase. In this revised document, it's imperative to distinguish the functionalities of Feature A from those of Feature B, reflecting the clarity observed in our Plan Of Change documentation. For functional requirements that specifically relate to integration points with Feature B (and not just at the category level), consider using terms such as "Mandated By Feature B", "Specified By Feature B", or "Provided By Feature B". This will clearly indicate the influence of Feature B on that particular function.

To illustrate my point regarding individual functional specifications:
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>

Where "Specification_1.1" represents the functional specification and "Category_1" denotes the requirement category.

Should you find more appropriate terminology, considering my English proficiency may fall short at times, I welcome your revisions. I value and trust your expertise. Above all, our objective is to ensure clear distinctions between the features in the new documentation, especially around integration points. I'd appreciate if you familiarize yourself with the context prior to making any changes.


Target Reason Of POC: The requirement of FeatureA goes through changes.
Target Reason of POC: Because other parts of the software has changes, which 
influences the current feature.


We intend to use the "Plan Of Change documentation" from Feature A to update it's original requirement. The goal is to ensure that the revised document aligns with the codebase and clearly differentiates between the functionalities of Feature A and Feature B. For functional requirements that specifically pertain to integration with Feature B, use terms like "Mandated By Feature B", "Specified By Feature B", or "Provided By Feature B". This terminology helps emphasize the influence of Feature B.

To clarify:
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Requirement_1.1>
   - <Requirement_1.2>

Here, "Requirement_1.1" is a functional requirement, and "Category_1" is its category. The specified terminology should be applied at the individual requirement level.
It's essential that our new documentation makes clear distinctions between the features, especially concerning integration points. Familiarize yourself with the context before making revisions, and I value your expertise in this matter.



You are a senior software architect. You are tasked with drafting a "Plan Of Change" documentation for an existing "Module Specification" detailed in the `[ModuleA]` section, based on functionalities provided by another recently developed "Module Specification" in the `[ModuleB]` section. This documentation should clarify the modifications or enhancements required for ModuleA, ensuring it efficiently leverages the capabilities provided by ModuleB.

**Background**:
In the realm of software engineering, as systems evolve and new module specifications are developed, it's imperative to reassess existing module specifications to ensure their alignment with the latest functionalities. The creation of a "Plan Of Change" documentation is a systematic approach to this reassessment. Through comprehensive reasoning, engineers not only identify areas where module specifications can be enhanced or integrated but also recognize when certain functionalities may become redundant or need removal. This process ensures that the system remains modular, coherent, and up-to-date with the latest requirements.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand "How To Use This Module" section from ModuleB.
2. **Preliminarily Identify The Most Relevant Items**: Browse through each category in the `4. Specifications` section of ModuleA. For each category, summarize the specific specification items that have the most relevance with ModuleB. This step will form a detailed shortlist for a deeper analysis.
3. For each specification item shortlisted in step 2, follow the structured reasoning:

   a. **Define the Current Functionality**:
      "When examining the specification item from ModuleA, it is observed that it encompasses [specific functionality or role of the specification item]."
      
   b. **Introduce and Contrast with ModuleB**:
      "On the other hand, ModuleB introduces [specific capability or specification of ModuleB], which has the potential to [complement/overlap with/challenge] the aforementioned functionality of the specification item."
      
   c. **Provide Clear Reasoning for Changes and Outcomes**:
      - "Given this relationship between the functionalities, it becomes [logical conclusion: evident/apparent/clear] that there's a need to [specific action: enhance/update/retain/remove/add] this specification item in ModuleA."
      - If modifying: "The modified description for this specification item, considering ModuleB's capabilities, would be [new detailed functional specification description]."
      - If removing: "This specification item from ModuleA is marked for removal due to [specific reason relating to ModuleB]."
      - If identifying a new requirement: "A new specification item for ModuleA, influenced by ModuleB, would be [detailed description of the new specification item]."

4. **Identify New Specification Items**: Based on the capabilities of ModuleB, list out any new specification items that should be added under the appropriate categories in ModuleA to fully leverage the functionalities of ModuleB.
5. Based on the structured reasoning from steps 3 and 4, start to draft the documentation following the structure of the `[Example]`.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Take a deep breath, think step by step meticulously, and provide comprehensive reasoning for each step.

### Prompt Versioning Mechanism Module Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
This module manages versioned prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides foundational functionality for entities to handle prompt variations, enabling comparative analysis between different versions. Central to this module is an Abstract Entity designed to be extended by other entities desiring prompt versioning capabilities. While the module focuses on prompt management, it does not oversee direct communication with LLMs.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. How To Use This Module:
- Entities wishing to utilize prompt versioning must extend the provided Abstract Entity.
- The Abstract Entity defines a default prompt that must be overridden by extending entities to suit their specific needs.
- Once an entity extends the Abstract Entity, the module automatically manages the creation, management, and retrieval of versioned prompts for that entity.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Users (such as other backend systems or APIs) can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with LLMs and extends the Abstract Entity must override its default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the overridden default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's overridden default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The system supports API-based comparative evaluations of different prompt versions, with future plans to incorporate a side-by-side comparison tool.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Each version's creation/modification timestamp is documented.

4.2. **Technical Specifications**:

- **Database Interaction**:
   - Efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for prompt version management are paramount.
   - Versions are recorded with unique identifiers, timestamps, and version numbers.



I wanna emphasize again about our context. So ChatGPT has executed one prompt. When it executed the prompt, it generated some outputs. Now the user has some opinions about the output. They are not satisfied about the output. So  the prompt evaluation prompt is used to analyze the possible problem with the original prompt given the three information "original prompt", "output", "user feedback". Could you please evaluate again step by step whether the latest prompt achieves this user requirement?
