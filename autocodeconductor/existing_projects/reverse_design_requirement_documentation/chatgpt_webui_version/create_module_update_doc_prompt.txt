[ModuleB]
### Prompt Versioning Mechanism Module Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
This module manages versioned prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides foundational functionality for entities to handle prompt variations, enabling comparative analysis between different versions. Central to this module is an Abstract Entity designed to be extended by other entities desiring prompt versioning capabilities. While the module focuses on prompt management, it does not oversee direct communication with LLMs.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. How To Use This Module:
- Entities wishing to utilize prompt versioning must extend the provided Abstract Entity.
- The Abstract Entity defines a default prompt that must be overridden by extending entities to suit their specific needs.
- Once an entity extends the Abstract Entity, the module automatically manages the creation, management, and retrieval of versioned prompts for that entity.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Users (such as other backend systems or APIs) can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with LLMs and extends the Abstract Entity must override its default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the overridden default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's overridden default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The system supports API-based comparative evaluations of different prompt versions, with future plans to incorporate a side-by-side comparison tool.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Each version's creation/modification timestamp is documented.

4.2. **Technical Specifications**:

- **Database Interaction**:
   - Efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for prompt version management are paramount.
   - Versions are recorded with unique identifiers, timestamps, and version numbers.

Version 3: Prompting language version.


*Introduction to the Prompting Programming Language**:

In the realm of large language models, purely natural language prompts often fall short in expressing structured constructs like loops and conditions, leading to unsatisfactory results. The prompting programming language was conceived to bridge this gap. It merges the logical precision of traditional programming with the comprehensibility of natural language. By employing familiar English constructs, this language lays out steps, conditions, operations, and loops in an intuitive and direct manner. Designed to mirror the graph-like structures inherent in human thought processes, the prompting programming language enables large language models to execute prompts more efficiently and accurately, bringing them closer to simulating human-like reasoning.

**How to Execute Prompting Code**:
Large language models like ChatGPT recognize and interpret the specific syntax and semantics of the prompting programming language. Constructs such as `IF` and `FOR EACH` are treated analogously to their traditional programming language counterparts, enabling the model to evaluate conditions and execute loops based on the embedded logic.

**Language Elements**:
- **Step**: A module signifying a specific operation, designed with a clear goal.
- **Action**: The concrete task within its parent step, providing explicit execution instructions.
- **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**: Overarching instruction for the entire procedure, ensuring consistent execution.
- **DIRECTIVE**: Guidelines tailored for a specific action.

Given this foundation, you are tasked to act as an interpreter for the following prompting code in the `[PromptingCode]` section, leveraging natural language reasoning while simulating a traditional coding execution process. The provided code has been crafted using the prompting programming language.
