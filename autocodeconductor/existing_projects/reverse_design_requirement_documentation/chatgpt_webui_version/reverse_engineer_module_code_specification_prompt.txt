Version 1: The role is Python architect. 
You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the module code specification documentation for an already-implemented module. Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time. Use this file to start the documentation.

### Context:
- "Part-Of" components refer to elements likely part of the same module, but their code isn't provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.
- "Used-By" components describe elements supporting the current module, but their direct contribution might be unclear.

### Criteria:
- Base your documentation on the format defined by the example in the `[Example]` section.
- Present the documentation in a copiable block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**: Identify its main functionalities.
2. **Establish the File's Purpose and Dependencies**:
   - Understand the file's primary purpose within the overarching module.
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the module? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the module is indirect or not part of the module, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.

3. **Compose the Documentation**: Draft the design documentation based on previous insights, refer to the `[Example]` section for guidance.

Follow the steps defined in the 'Procedure' section. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step.

### Event Notification Module Code Specification

#### 1. Module Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
This module is designed to implement the Observer Pattern, enabling multiple subscribers to be notified of specific events. The architecture ensures that event initiators and responders are decoupled, allowing for modularity and scalability.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined

- **Publisher (New)**
    - **Purpose**: Acts as the broadcaster for events. It notifies all subscribers when an event occurs and logs them to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `subscribers_list`: List storing all the registered subscribers.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `trigger_event()`: Initiates an event, logs it, and notifies subscribers.
        - `add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)`: Adds a new subscriber to the subscribers list.
        - `log_event_to_database(event: Event)`: Logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Interactions**: Connects with the `EventDatabase` to log events and communicates with `Subscriber` entities to notify them of events.

- **Subscriber (New) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Purpose**: Monitors and responds to particular events triggered by the `Publisher`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `event_history`: List to store received events.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `on_event_received(event: Event)`: Handles the event and stores it in `event_history`.
    - **Interactions**: Receives event notifications from the `Publisher`.

###### 1.2.2. Part-Of Components (Pending File Provision)

- **NotificationService (Part-Of) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the module, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: This service might be responsible for sending notifications to external systems or users when specific events are triggered.

##### 1.3. Used-By Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

- **EventDatabase (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: A database component designed to store all triggered events.
    - **Interactions**: Stores events triggered by the `Publisher`.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- Users or systems interface with the `Publisher` to initiate events.
- Once an event is triggered, the `Publisher` logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
- The `Publisher` then notifies all `Subscriber` entities of this event.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- None.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this module.
  - Components marked with `(Part-Of)` are identified but not fully defined within the module.
  - Components marked with `(Used-By)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies within the module context.

Second Prompt: Refining and Expanding the Design Documentation

You are a large language model performing as a python expert. Your task is to refine and expand the module code design documentation provided in the `[InitialModuleCodeDesign]` for an already-implemented module. Given the context size constraints, you can handle one file at a time. Use the provided file to update the initial documentation. The code is given in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Context:
- The goal is to further develop the documentation, potentially transitioning components from the "Part-Of" section to "Fully Defined" if the associated code is now provided.
- Ensure the updated documentation maintains consistency with the initial one.

### Criteria:
- The updated documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
   - Scrutinize the code file in the `[SourceCode]` section, identifying primary functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the File's Main Component**:
   - Establish the main role of the file within the module's broader context.
   - If the main component of the file matches a "Part-Of" in the given documentation, move it to the "Fully Defined" section and supply its complete details.

3. **Assess Dependencies**:
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - Is the component already defined as "Fully Defined" in the given documentation. If yes, no further action is needed.
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the module? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the module is indirect or not part of the module, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.
4. **Update and Refine the Documentation**: Based on the insights from previous analysis, update the existing design documentation.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.

### BaseLLMIntegration Module Code Specification

#### 1. Module Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
The `BaseLLMIntegration` module is designed to provide a standardized interface for all Language Model (LLM) integrations. The abstract base class ensures that any derived classes implement the necessary methods to process input messages and return LLM responses.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined

- **BaseLLMIntegration (New)**
    - **Purpose**: Serves as a common interface for various LLM integrations, ensuring consistent message processing across different implementations.
    - **Attributes**: None.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `process_input_messages(input_messages: list)`: An abstract method that processes a list of input messages and returns the LLM's responses.
    - **Interactions**: None in this file, but derived classes in other parts of the module will interact with this base class by implementing the `process_input_messages` method.

##### 1.3. Interactions Overview
- Derived classes from the overarching module will implement the `process_input_messages` method to provide specific integrations with the LLM.
  
##### 1.4. External Dependencies
- None.
