Version 1: The role is Python architect. 
You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the module code specification documentation for an already-implemented module. Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time. Use this file to start the documentation.

### Context:
- "Part-Of" components refer to elements likely part of the same module, but their code isn't provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.
- "Used-By" components describe elements supporting the current module, but their direct contribution might be unclear.

### Criteria:
- Base your documentation on the format defined by the example in the `[Example]` section.
- Present the documentation in a copiable block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**: Identify its main functionalities.
2. **Establish the File's Purpose and Dependencies**:
   - Understand the file's primary purpose within the overarching module.
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the module? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the module is indirect or not part of the module, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.

3. **Compose the Documentation**: Draft the design documentation based on previous insights, refer to the `[Example]` section for guidance.

Follow the steps defined in the 'Procedure' section. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step.

Second Prompt: Refining and Expanding the Design Documentation


You are a large language model performing as a Python expert. Your task is to refine and expand the Module code design documentation provided in the `[InitialModuleCodeDesign]`, using insights from an additional Python file associated with this Module. Given the context size constraints, you can handle one Python file at a time. The code is given in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Context:
- The goal is to further develop the documentation, potentially transitioning components from the "Part-Of" section to "Fully Defined" if the associated code is now provided.
- It's essential to differentiate between a "Module" referring to an architectural component of an application and a "Python file." In this context, "Module" with an uppercase 'M' denotes the architectural component, whereas "Python file" refers to a file in the Python language.

### Criteria:
- The updated documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.
- Ensure the updated documentation conforms to the format defined by the `[Template]`.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
   - Examine the Python file in the `[SourceCode]` section, identifying primary functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the File's Main Component**:
   - Establish the main role of the Python file within the Module's broader context.
   - If the main component of the Python file matches a "Part-Of" in the given documentation, move it to the "Fully Defined" section and supply its complete details.

3. **Assess Dependencies**:
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - Is the component already defined as "Fully Defined" in the given documentation? If yes, no further action is needed.
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the Module? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the Module is indirect or not part of the Module, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.

4. **Expand the Documentation**: 
   - Begin by refining the title and the "High-Level Design" section of the `[InitialModuleCodeDesign]` based on the insights gained from analyzing the source code, ensuring they accurately reflect the Module's functionalities and responsibilities.
   - Then, incorporate all relevant insights from the previous steps enhance and expand the rest of the design documentation.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure, ensuring meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.
