First Prompt: Initiating the Design Documentation**


You are a Python architect. Your task is to create feature code design documentation for an existing feature. Due to size constraints, focus on one file at a time, provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Criteria:
- The documentation should follow the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` from the `[Template]` section.
- Present the final documentation in a copiable code block.

1. **Review the Source Code**:
    - Examine the code in the [SourceCode] section and note key functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the Purpose of the Code. Identify the broader objective the code is trying to achieve**


3. **Analyse File's Dependencies**:
    - Analyze each non third-party project dependency in the same root package namespace as the provided source code:
        - Guess the functionality of each dependency.
        - Articulate whether the dependency's functionality directly affects or is essential to the identified feature, then label it as `Placeholder Components` with its potential purpose.
        - Articulate whether the dependency provides utility or support without being core to the feature's functionality, label it as `Dependencies`.

6. **Draft the Documentation**:
   - Use insights from the above analysis to create the code design documentation.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think step by step meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.



Version: Correct one. Obviously using Part-Of is working much better than all the other prompts. I think the reason is that its easy to derive that the relationship of the word with the feature. Then from the sentence to derive part-of is also easy. 

You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the design documentation for an already-implemented feature. Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time. Use this file to start the documentation.

### Context:
- "Part-Of" components refer to elements likely associated with the same feature, but their code isn't provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.
- "Used-By" components describe elements supporting the current feature, but their direct contribution might be unclear.

### Criteria:
- Base your documentation on the format defined by template in `[Template]` section.
- Present the documentation in a copiable block..

### Procedure:
1. **Inspect the Source Code**:
   - Dive into the code in the `[SourceCode]` section, taking note of primary functionalities.

2. **Establish the File's Purpose and Dependencies**:
   - Understand the file's primary purpose within the overarching feature.
   - Examine each project dependency under the root namespace as the file (excluding standard third-party libraries, such as json, panda etc) and answer:
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the feature? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the feature is indirect or not part of the feature, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.

3. **Draft the Initial Documentation**:
   - Craft the initial documentation based on insights from the file.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think step by step meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.

Second Prompt: Refining and Expanding the Design Documentation

You are a Python architect. Your task is to refine and expand the feature code design documentation provided in the `[InitialFeatureDesign]` for an already-implemented feature. Given the context size constraints, you can handle one file at a time. Use the provided file to update the initial documentation. The code is given in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Context:
- The goal is to further develop the documentation, potentially transitioning components from the "Placeholder" section to "Fully Defined" if the associated code is now provided.
- Ensure the updated documentation maintains consistency with the initial one.

### Criteria:
- The revised documentation must adhere to the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` provided in the `[Template]` section.
- The updated documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
   - Scrutinize the code file in the `[SourceCode]` section, identifying primary functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the File's Main Component**:
   - Establish the main role of the file within the feature's broader context.
   - If the main component of the file matches a "Placeholder" in the existing documentation and its code is now provided, move it to the "Fully Defined" section and supply its complete details.

3. **Assess Dependencies**:
   - Evaluate each project dependency within the file:
     - If a component is already defined as "Fully Defined" based on the initial documentation and appears in the new code as a dependency, no further action is needed.
     - For any new dependency that wasn't recognized in the initial documentation:
       - If it's directly related to the feature but its code isn't supplied, insert it into the `Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)` section with its tentative purpose.
       - If it's an auxiliary or external tool/service supporting the feature, include it under the `Dependencies (Unchanged Components)` section.

4. **Update and Refine the Documentation**:
   - Incorporate insights from the file and its dependencies into the design documentation, aligning with the template.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.
