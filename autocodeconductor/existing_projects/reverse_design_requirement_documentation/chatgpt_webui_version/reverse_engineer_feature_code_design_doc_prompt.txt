First Prompt: Initiating the Design Documentation**

You are a Python architect. Your task is to create feature code design documentation for an existing feature. Due to size constraints, focus on one file at a time, provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Criteria:
- The documentation should follow the feature code design documentation template` from the `[Template]` section.
- Present the final documentation in a copiable code block.

1. **Review the Source Code**: Examine the code in the [SourceCode] section and note key functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the Purpose of the Code. Identify the broader objective the code is trying to achieve**

3. **Analyse File's Dependencies**:
     - Examine non-third-party dependencies within the same root package.
and answer:
        - What function might this dependency serve?
        - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the feature? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the feature is indirect or not part of the feature, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Dependencies (Unchanged Components)`.

4. **Draft the Documentation**:
   - Use insights from the previous analysis to create the code design documentation.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think step by step meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.


Version 2: This is the first prompt which works 100% percent. It identifies 
all the dependencies to the correct place. The possible reason is that i have 
used the example section to apply one-shot technique.

You're a Python architect. Create a code design documentation for a feature found in the `[SourceCode]` section, focusing on one file.

### Criteria:
- Use the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` from the `[Template]` section.
- Formulate the documentation in a code block.

Steps:
1. **Review the Source Code**: Identify its main functionalities.
2. **Determine the Code's Purpose**: Ascertain the broader aim of the code.
3. **Analyze Dependencies**: 
    - Examine non-third-party dependencies within the same root package.
    - Classify each as either `Placeholder Components` if its function is clear and contributes to the feature, or `Dependencies (Unchanged Components)` if uncertain.
4. **Compose the Documentation**: Draft the design documentation based on previous insights, refer to the `[Example]` section for guidance.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section. Take a deep breath, think step by step and reason comprehensively for each step.

Version: Correct one(Use this one). Obviously using Part-Of is working much better than all the other prompts. I think the reason is that its easy to derive that the relationship of the word with the feature. Then from the sentence to derive part-of is also easy. 

You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the design documentation for an already-implemented feature. Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time. Use this file to start the documentation.

### Context:
- "Part-Of" components refer to elements likely part of the same feature, but their code isn't provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.
- "Used-By" components describe elements supporting the current feature, but their direct contribution might be unclear.

### Criteria:
- Base your documentation on the format defined by template in `[Template]` section.
- Present the documentation in a copiable block..

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**: Identify its main functionalities.
2. **Establish the File's Purpose and Dependencies**:
   - Understand the file's primary purpose within the overarching feature.
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the feature? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the feature is indirect or not part of the feature, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.

3. **Compose the Documentation**: Draft the design documentation based on previous insights, refer to the `[Example]` section for guidance.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section. Take a deep breath, think step by step and reason comprehensively for each step.

Second Prompt: Refining and Expanding the Design Documentation

You are a Python architect. Your task is to refine and expand the feature code design documentation provided in the `[InitialFeatureCodeDesign]` for an already-implemented feature. Given the context size constraints, you can handle one file at a time. Use the provided file to update the initial documentation. The code is given in the `[SourceCode]` section.

### Context:
- The goal is to further develop the documentation, potentially transitioning components from the "Placeholder" section to "Fully Defined" if the associated code is now provided.
- Ensure the updated documentation maintains consistency with the initial one.

### Criteria:
- The revised documentation must adhere to the `Feature Code Design Documentation Template` provided in the `[Template]` section.
- The updated documentation should be presented in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
   - Scrutinize the code file in the `[SourceCode]` section, identifying primary functionalities and structures.

2. **Determine the File's Main Component**:
   - Establish the main role of the file within the feature's broader context.
   - If the main component of the file matches a "Part-Of" in the given documentation, move it to the "Fully Defined" section and supply its complete details.

3. **Assess Dependencies**:
   - Identify non-third-party dependencies within the same root package and answer:
      - Is the component already defined as "Fully Defined" in the given documentation. If yes, no further action is needed.
      - What function might this dependency serve?
      - Does the suspected function of the dependency directly contribute to the feature? If its functionality is unclear or its contribution to the feature is indirect or not part of the feature, label it as `Used-By`. Otherwise, label it as `Part-Of` and state its potential function. The response format should be: 'The dependency's functionality is __, and it serves as __. Label it as `Part-Of`. If its role is uncertain, label it as `Used-By`.
4. **Update and Refine the Documentation**: Based on the insights from previous analysis, update the existing design documentation, refer to the `[Example]` section for guidance.


You are a Python architect. You're tasked with refining a given initial feature code design documentation in the `[InitialFeatureDesign]` based on the additional given source code in the `[SourceCode]` section.

    - **Tentative Purpose**: Likely a base class for different workflow types. Associates with steps to provide context.

##### 1.3. Used-By Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

- **WorkspaceSetting (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Represents the settings associated with the workspace.
    - **Interactions**: Used by `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` to manage workspace settings.

- **LLMIntegrationRegistry (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Manages integrations with an LLM system.
    - **Interactions**: Used by `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` to manage LLM integrations.

- **PromptTemplate (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Assumed to relate to the construction of prompts for each step in the workflow.
    - **Interactions**: Utilized within the `BaseStep` and `RequirementStep` for constructing the prompt.

- **PromptVersioningMixin (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Provides versioning capabilities for the steps.
    - **Interactions**: Incorporated into the `BaseStep` class for versioning functionalities.

- **UniqueIDGenerator (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Generates unique IDs.
    - **Interactions**: Used by the `BaseStep` to generate a unique ID for each instance.

- **PromptTemplateVariable (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: Represents a variable in the `PromptTemplate` that captures specific input or details.
    - **Interactions**: Utilized within the `RequirementStep` for prompt variable details.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
The `AutomatedCodingWorkflow` initializes its steps based on the `WORKFLOW_CONFIG`. Each step is represented by an instance of a class derived from `BaseStep`. The workflow also interacts with the `LLMIntegrationRegistry` to manage integrations with an LLM system. The `execute_step` method allows for the execution of individual steps by their IDs, while the `start_workflow` method is intended to start the entire workflow process.

The `BaseStep` provides foundational methods and attributes required for individual steps in the workflow. It uses versioning capabilities from `PromptVersioningMixin` and constructs prompts possibly using `PromptTemplate`.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- `json`: Standard Python library used for JSON serialization.
- `abc`: Standard Python library for defining abstract base classes.
- `typing_extensions`: External library for extended typing support.

Well done. Thank you. Could you please give me back the complete updated documentation, so that the Agent program can directly override the existing one 
in database?
