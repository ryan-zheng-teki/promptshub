### Feature Code Design Documentation Template:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
- Brief overview of the primary architecture.
- Design patterns, principles, or structures that will be applied.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined
For each component:
  - **Name (New) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality.
    - **Attributes**:
      - `attribute_name`: Short description of the attribute and its significance.
      ... Continue for all attributes.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
      - `method_name()`: Describe the method's purpose, expected input, and output.
      ... Continue for all methods.
    - **Interactions**: Describe how this component interacts with other components.

... Continue for all fully defined new components.

###### 1.2.2. Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)
For each component:
  - **Name (New/Placeholder) [extends/relates OtherComponentName]** (if applicable)
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the feature, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: A general understanding or assumption about the component's role and tasks based on current knowledge.

... Continue for placeholders.

##### 1.3. Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

For each component:
  - **Name (Existing)**
    - **Purpose**: Clear description of the component's role and functionality.
    - **Interactions**: Describe its interactions with new components, if any.

... Continue for all dependencies.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- A broader perspective on how new components interact with each other and with existing components.
- Highlight any specific sequence of operations or workflows.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- List any third-party libraries, services, or tools that will be used.
- Specific versions or configurations to be aware of.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- A UML diagram showcasing the relationships and interactions between components.
- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this feature.
  - Components marked with `(New/Placeholder)` are identified but not fully defined.
  - Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies.

## Example
### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
This feature is designed to implement the Observer Pattern, enabling multiple subscribers to be notified of certain events. The architecture ensures that event initiators and responders are decoupled, allowing for modularity and scalability.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined

- **Publisher (New)**
    - **Purpose**: Acts as the broadcaster for events. It notifies all subscribers when an event occurs and logs them to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `subscribers_list`: List storing all the registered subscribers.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `trigger_event()`: Initiates an event, logs it, and notifies subscribers.
        - `add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)`: Adds a new subscriber to the subscribers list.
        - `log_event_to_database(event: Event)`: Logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Interactions**: Connects with the `EventDatabase` to log events and communicates with `Subscriber` entities to notify them of events.

- **Subscriber (New) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Purpose**: Monitors and responds to particular events triggered by the `Publisher`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `event_history`: List to store received events.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `on_event_received(event: Event)`: Handles the event and stores it in `event_history`.
    - **Interactions**: Receives event notifications from the `Publisher`.

###### 1.2.2. Placeholder Components (Pending File Provision)

- **NotificationService (New/Placeholder) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the feature, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: This service might be responsible for sending notifications to external systems or users when specific events are triggered.

##### 1.3. Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

- **EventDatabase (Existing)**
    - **Purpose**: A database component designed to store all triggered events.
    - **Interactions**: Stores events triggered by the `Publisher`.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- Users or systems interface with the `Publisher` to initiate events.
- Once an event is triggered, the `Publisher` logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
- The `Publisher` then notifies all `Subscriber` entities of this event.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- None.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this feature.
  - Components marked with `(New/Placeholder)` are identified but not fully defined.
  - Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies.
