#### Prompt Versioning Mechanism for Optimal Communication with Large Language Models

#### 1. Feature Description:
This feature introduces a versioning mechanism for prompts, specifically designed to offer a standardized capability for any entity or component that communicates with Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective is to harness the inherent variability in LLM responses based on prompt nuances, providing flexibility and a means for comparative analysis between different versions to pinpoint the most effective prompt.

#### 2. Feature Dependencies:
- **None**: This feature operates independently and does not rely on other features developed in the application.

#### 3. How To Use This Feature:
- Entities wishing to leverage this feature should define their default prompt.
- After setting the default prompt, the versioning mechanism will automatically handle the creation, management, and retrieval of versioned prompts for that entity.

#### 4. Requirements:

4.1. **Functional Requirements**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Users (like other backend systems or APIs) can choose any archived version as the current effective prompt, which will replace the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component communicating with LLMs must have a distinct default prompt.
   - If entity-specific prompts are missing in the database, the default prompt initializes the database, setting as v1 and serving as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Prior to any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is missing in the database, the system uses the entity's default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can create a new prompt version when modifications are made to the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are stored for each entity.
   - If introducing a new version surpasses the 4-version limit, the oldest version is deleted.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The system allows for an API-based comparative evaluation of various prompt versions, with plans to integrate a side-by-side comparison tool in future versions.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are represented using simple incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Every version's creation/modification timestamp is stored.

4.2. **Technical Requirements**:
- **Database Interaction**:
   - Efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing prompt versions are essential.
   - Versions are stored with unique identifiers, timestamps, and version numbers.


Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.





Conversation:
In software engineering, each feature comes with its corresponding feature requirement documentation. As development progresses, features may integrate functionalities from others. It's crucial that the documentation of a feature like Feature A remains updated, especially if it integrates functionality from Feature B. There's a proposal to introduce a "Feature Update" documentation for capturing such changes. However, detailing the interplay between features can be challenging due to the high-level nature of requirement documents. To ensure clarity, it's proposed that each feature's title be abbreviated by using the first letter of each word, creating a unique short name for easy referencing. This would help in clearly defining the boundaries and dependencies between features in the documentation.



We aim to integrate the "Plan Of Change documentation" from Feature A with its initial requirements. Doing so will result in an updated requirements document that aligns seamlessly with the codebase. In this revised document, it's imperative to distinguish the functionalities of Feature A from those of Feature B, reflecting the clarity observed in our Plan Of Change documentation. For functional requirements that specifically relate to integration points with Feature B (and not just at the category level), consider using terms such as "Mandated By Feature B", "Specified By Feature B", or "Provided By Feature B". This will clearly indicate the influence of Feature B on that particular function.

To illustrate my point regarding individual functional requirements:
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Requirement_1.1>
   - <Requirement_1.2>

Where "Requirement_1.1" represents the functional requirement and "Category_1" denotes the requirement category.

Should you find more appropriate terminology, considering my English proficiency may fall short at times, I welcome your revisions. I value and trust your expertise. Above all, our objective is to ensure clear distinctions between the features in the new documentation, especially around integration points. I'd appreciate if you familiarize yourself with the context prior to making any changes.



Target Reason Of POC: The requirement of FeatureA goes through changes.
Target Reason of POC: Because other parts of the software has changes, which 
influences the current feature.




Version 3:
Absolutely! Let's adjust the prompt to be more explicit by incorporating the structure you've provided to make it clear for ChatGPT.

We intend to use the "Plan Of Change documentation" from Feature A to update it's original requirement. The goal is to ensure that the revised document aligns with the codebase and clearly differentiates between the functionalities of Feature A and Feature B. For functional requirements that specifically pertain to integration with Feature B, use terms like "Mandated By Feature B", "Specified By Feature B", or "Provided By Feature B". This terminology helps emphasize the influence of Feature B.

To clarify:
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Requirement_1.1>
   - <Requirement_1.2>

Here, "Requirement_1.1" is a functional requirement, and "Category_1" is its category. The specified terminology should be applied at the individual requirement level.

If you think of a better terminology or see areas for improvement in my phrasing, please suggest changes. It's essential that our new documentation makes clear distinctions between the features, especially concerning integration points. Familiarize yourself with the context before making revisions, and I value your expertise in this matter.
