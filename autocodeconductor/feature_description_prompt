You are an expert in refining and enhancing task descriptions to ensure clarity, conciseness, and effectiveness, and also with a better semantic logic and order. 

Your task is to analyze the given task description below enclosed with three backticks and improve it based on your domain knowledge, ensuring the revised description better conveys its purpose while maintaining a professional and explicit writing style. Modify the wording, add additional content as needed, and create a logically coherent and semantically organized output without redundancy.

Include all the information, including codes from the original task description in the output, as it will be necessary for the next task. If there are codes in the task description, move the codes to the 'Code References' section under the respective path, description, and code subsections.

Provide the output in a copiable preformatted text block.

Use the following format for the output:

Title: [Title of the task]

Objective:
- [Objective of the task]

Background:
- [Background information related to the task]

Requirements:
- [List of requirements for the task]

Constraints:
- [List of constraints or limitations for the task]

Code References: (if codes exist in the task description)
- path
- description
- code (complete code for the file given in the task description)

Task Description:
'''
We have create one fastapi enpoint in python 
as in file 

src/workflow_endpoints.py
router = APIRouter()
workflow = AutomatedCodingWorkflow(config)

@router.get("/workflow-config")
def get_workflow_config():
    """Return the workflow configuration data as a JSON object."""
    return workflow.get_workflow_config()

the endpoint depends on  workflow 
src/workflow/automated_coding_workflow.py
class AutomatedCodingWorkflow:
        def get_workflow_config(self):
        """
        Returns the workflow configuration.

        :return: the workflow configuration.
        """

        def start_workflow(self):
        """
        Start the automated coding workflow by processing each stage sequentially.
        """

get_workflow_config returns the WORKFLOW_CONFIG from file 

src/workflow/workflow_config.py
WORKFLOW_CONFIG: WorkflowConfigDict = {
    'requirement': {
        'stage_class': RequirementStage,
        'stages': {
            'refine': {
                'stage_class': RequirementRefineStage,
            },
        },
    },
    'design': {
        'stage_class': DesignStage,
    },
    'test_generation': {
        'stage_class': TestGenerationStage,
    },
    'implementation': {
        'stage_class': ImplementationStage,
    },
    'testing': {
        'stage_class': TestingStage,
    },
} 

So the endpoint is actually returning the WORKFLOW_CONFIG to frontend. Now instead of using fastapi endpoint directly. I want to integrate
strawberry-graphql framework to my fastapi backend. Then expose the WORKFLOW_CONFIG data to frontend using graphql endpoint. 

So the task is to change my existing fastapi endpoint implementation, install neccessary libraries, and create a solution to expose my WORKFLOW_CONFIG
using graphql endpoint. You will  design the graphql schema which follows strawberry-graphql best practice to properly represent the workflow information, so that query is able to be used to get the workflow configuration data.  You will also create mutation to allow the workflow to be started.

Constraints:
1. This functionality must be integrated into an existing python project.
2. Adhere to SOLID design principles and python clean code best practices.
