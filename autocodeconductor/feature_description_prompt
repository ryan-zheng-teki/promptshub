The task name is "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription". In this task, you will perform as an expert in refining and enhancing task descriptions. Your task is to analyze the provided task description enclosed with three backticks, improve it based on your domain knowledge, and ensure the revised description better conveys its purpose while maintaining a professional and explicit writing style.

Adjust the wording, add additional content or requirements as needed, drawing from your knowledge of similar features, and create a logically coherent and semantically organized output without redundancy.

You should incorporate all information, including codes, from the original task description in the output, as it will be stored in a third-party platform for later reference. 

For instance, if you recognize file paths and codes in the task description, you should extract the codes to the 'Code References' section, and put them under the respective path, description, and code subsections. Identify constraints such as programming languages, frameworks etc from the task description and include them in the 'Constraints' section.

Use the following format for the output:

```Title: [Title of the task]

Objective:
- [Objective of the task]

Background:
- [Background information related to the task]

Requirements:
- [List of requirements for the task]

Constraints:
- [List of constraints or limitations for the task]

Code References: (if codes exist in the task description)
- path
- description
- code (complete code for the file given in the task description)
```

Provide the complete output in a copiable preformatted text block.

Task description:

```
Enable file and console logging at the same time for my python application. I have 
I currently have this line 

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.INFO)

in my src/app.py

"""
app.py: The main entry point for a Python application with three modes of operation: command line, gRPC server mode, and GraphQL server mode.

The script allows users to:
- Interact with a chat system through PuppeteerLLMIntegration in command line mode.
- Run a gRPC server for AutomatedCodingWorkflowService in gRPC server mode.
- Run a FastAPI server with GraphQL endpoints using the Strawberry GraphQL library in GraphQL server mode.

The mode, configuration file, server hostname, and port are specified through command line arguments. The script parses these arguments and executes the appropriate mode function with the necessary parameters.

Usage:
- For command line mode: python app.py --mode commandline
- For gRPC server mode: python app.py --mode grpcserver --host 127.0.0.1 --port 50051
- For GraphQL server mode: python app.py --mode graphqlserver --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Can you combine this requirement with the Task Description from the "refining and enhancing task descriptions" task, and reperform the "refining and enhancing task descriptions" task?


Objective:
- The objective of this task is to develop an LLM integration for OpenAI GPT models (gpt3.5, gpt4) into the existing agent program.

Background:
- The agent program under development aims to integrate with various LLM (Language Learning Models) using their APIs. An abstract base class, BaseLLMIntegration, has been designed to define a common interface for all LLM integrations. This base class supports an optional project configuration attribute.

Requirements:
- Create an LLM integration for OpenAI GPT models (gpt3.5, gpt4) using the OpenAI API.
- Leverage the BaseLLMIntegration class from the file src/llm_integrations/base_llm_integration.py.
- The integration should be able to process a list of input messages and return the LLM's responses.
- The default model, gpt4, and the API key are configured in the config.toml file, which is provided by the global config object. Ensure these configurations are appropriately utilized.

Constraints:
- The task requires knowledge of Python programming and asynchronous programming concepts.
- Understanding of OpenAI GPT API and LLMs is essential.
- The base class, BaseLLMIntegration, must be used as the foundation for the new class.

Code References:
- src/llm_integrations/base_llm_integration.py
    - Description: This file contains the BaseLLMIntegration abstract base class for Language Model integrations. It now supports an optional project configuration (a dictionary) as an attribute.
    - Code:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseLLMIntegration(ABC):
    """
    BaseLLMIntegration is an abstract base class that defines the common interface for all LLM integrations.
    It now includes an optional config attribute for providing project configurations.

    :type config: dict, optional

        self.config = config

    async def process_input_messages(self, input_messages):
        """

You will need to construct a software ticket based on the short description i give in the "TicketDescription" section. The short description contains keywords, code references sometimes because i am lazy.
