The task name is "Refine And Enhance Task Description". In this task, you will perform as an expert in refining and enhancing task descriptions. Your task is to analyze the provided task description given in "Task Description" section, improve it based on your domain and knowledge of doing similar task, and ensure the revised description better conveys its purpose.

Adjust the wording, add additional content or requirements as needed based your knowledge your knowledge of similar features, and create a logically coherent and semantically organized output without redundancy.

For instance, if you recognize file paths and codes in the task description, you should extract the codes to the 'Code References' section, and put them under the respective path, description, and code subsections. Identify constraints such as programming languages, frameworks etc from the task description and include them in the 'Constraints' section.

You should use json format for the output. The json format contains the following keys
Title, Objective, Background, Requirements, Constraints, Code References.


```Title: [Title of the task]

Objective:
- [Objective of the task]

Background:
- [Background information related to the task]

Requirements:
- [List of requirements for the task]

Constraints:
- [List of constraints or limitations for the task]


Provide the complete output in a copiable preformatted text block.

Task description:

```
blablab
```


You will need to create based on the short description i give in the "TicketDescription" section. The short description could sometimes contain only keywords, sometimes include code references as well, sometimes its just a simple description what needs to be achieved. you will need to create a more comprehensive software ticket
based on your analysis of the information. You will your reasoning skill from analysising the description to creating a software ticket. It's not one-step to conclusion.

Task Description: 
integrating multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, Google Bard


Reasoning: The requirement seems to trying to integrating multiple LLMs.
Based on my knowledge of integrating third party providers, such as OpeanAI, or Google Bard, they provide api_token. They also have different sdk libraries provided.

So the best approach of this ticket is to use their sdks. 

Based on SOLID principles, and clean code. 

The normal design would be to create one BaseLLMIntegration abastract class, and provide a generic
interface in the abstract class, and implement different concrete subclasses implementing the interface.

Hense, i will create BaseLLMIntegration with public interface send_messassage(), and i will create two concrete subclasses OpenAILLMIntegration, GoogleBardIntegration

Based on my knowledge of OpenAI integration, we can use create_completion API. 
...


Summary: Based on the reasoning result, i will create a software ticket
to create 
src/llmBaseLLMIntegration::send_message
src/llm
```





The task name is "Refine And Enhance Task Description". In this task, you will perform detailed analysis based on a short description provided in the "Target Ticket Description" section. The short description may vary in format; it could contain only keywords, include code references, or simply describe what needs to be achieved.

Your task is to synthesize this information and construct a comprehensive software ticket. Ensure that your analysis of the description is thorough and carefully reasoned, as this task is not a one-step process but a meticulous journey from understanding the issue to devising a logical, and structured software task. 

Use the following format for the output:

```Title: [Title of the task]

Objective:
- [Objective of the task]

Background:
- [Background information related to the task]

Requirements:
- [List of requirements for the task]

Constraints:
- [List of constraints or limitations for the task]

Code References: (extracted codes from the task description)
- path
- description
- code (complete code for the file given in the task description)
```

Target Ticket Description:
'create a symantic index for the source code. In source code, normally, the function name , and its description together would normally represent
a general funcationality. So we can design a standard construct which will be used to generate a vector. In general, we will need to create vector. and store in vector db. Then we will also need to implement search feature given user input as query.'





The task name is "Refine And Enhance Task Description". In this task, you will perform as an expert in refining and enhancing task descriptions. Your task is to analyze the provided task description given in "Task Description" section, improve it based on your domain and knowledge of doing similar task, and ensure the revised description better conveys its purpose while maintaining a professional and explicit writing style.

Adjust the wording, add additional content or requirements as needed, drawing from your knowledge of similar features, and create a logically coherent and semantically organized output without redundancy.

You should try to understand the code in the "Code References" section, as you might need to
reference either function name or module name or class name in your improved refined task description.

Use the following format for the output:

```Title: [Title of the task]

Objective:
- [Objective of the task]

Background:
- [Background information related to the task]

Requirements:
- [List of requirements for the task]

Constraints:
- [List of constraints or limitations for the task]

Task description:

```
I have created on python code parser, after parsing the module, i eventually want to 
have filepath+module docstring, filepath+function+function docstring,
filepath+class+class docstring, filepath+class+method+method docstring

these fundamental information entity. Then i will need to convert these fundamental information entity to vector, and then store in the vector database.

The whole flow is not achieved yet. So The task is to check what is still missing, what
needs to be refactored etc
```
