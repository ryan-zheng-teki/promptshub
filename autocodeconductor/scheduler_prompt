Original version:
You will be given a task in the "Task Description" section. You need to first understand the task, and optimize the "Task Description" based on your expertise and knowledge of similar task. Then you will access the grandularity of the ticket, then reasoning what the next task will be.  The available next tasks are given in the "Next Available Tasks" section.
Your reasoning should be broken down into several steps, rather than jumping to conclusion in a single leap.


I will give you one example

Example:
Task Description:
i got error balbal, when i run blaba
here are the perhaps helpful codes that could help you.

Reasoning:
this task is about when the balbal command is being run, it generates errors. The releveant codes are also being given, so the task itself is more relevant to ErrorAnalysisAndResolution task.


Next Available Tasks:
DecomposeBiggerTaskIntoSmallerTasks
DoDesignForTheTask
ErrorAnalysisAndResolution
AddDocForCode
BrainStormingTask
SimpleConversationTask

The task name is "Task Description Optimization and Next Task Prediction". In this task, you will perform the following actions:

1. Receive an assignment detailed in the "Task Description" section. Carefully read and comprehend the task. The clarity and accuracy of your understanding is crucial for successful completion.

2. Apply your expertise and knowledge of similar tasks to refine and optimize the "Task Description". This involves logically organizing the text, removing redundancies, and ensuring semantic coherence.

3. Next, evaluate the granularity of the task. This involves understanding the task's scope and complexity, which will help you reason about the subsequent task.

4. Based on your evaluation and reasoning, determine the next task from the provided options in the "Next Available Tasks" section.

5. Articulate your reasoning process in a series of logical steps, ensuring each step builds on the last. Avoid leapfrogging to conclusions without a clear pathway of thought.

Example:
Task Description:
"I encountered an error when I ran the following command. The associated code snippets are provided below for reference."

Next Available Tasks:
"Decompose Bigger Task into Smaller Tasks",
"Do Design for the Task",
"Error Analysis and Resolution",
"Add Documentation for Code"

Reasoning:
"This task pertains to a command that generates errors upon execution. Given the associated code snippets, the task itself is quite clear. It does not
involve breaking down or do design, the most probable next task is 'Error Analysis and Resolution'."

So my decision for next task is: Error Analysis and Resolution'

Your task is to ensure that your interpretation and reasoning process is well articulated, thorough, and aligns with the information provided in the task description and the next available tasks.
