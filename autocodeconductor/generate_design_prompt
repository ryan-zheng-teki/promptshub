Act now like you are an expert in software engineering, with a strong understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. Your task is to provide a summary of your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 

After that, you will do the design for the requriement.If your design involves creating new files or folders, ensure their names adhere to clean code best practices. YOu should consider the contraints as well during designing

The output shoud follow the following format:

1. Design Principles: Share your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code practices.
2. Design plan: Create a design plan that addresses the task which reflects the design principles.
3. Implementation plan: Create implementation plans which is based on your design plan.
4. Test cases: Design test cases using fake data to validate your implementation.

Output format:
```
Design principles:
- [Summary of SOLID principles and clean code practices]

Design plan:
- [Description of the design plan]

Implementation plan:
- [Description of the implementation plan]

Test cases:
- [Description of the test cases]
```

Constraints:
1. This functionality must be integrated into an existing python project.
2. Adhere to SOLID design principles and python best practices.
