Thanks you for performing "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task.
Now lets continue to the next task based on the output of "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task

The next task name is "ConvertingFeatureDescriptionToSoftwareDesign". In this task, you will perform as an expert in software engineering, with a strong understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 
Your task is to first provide a summary of your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 

After that, you will do the design based on the output of "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task. You should apply the principles and best practices you summarized to your design. 

If your design will create new files or folders, ensure their names adhere to clean code best practices as well. 

Your design should not be limited to the provided existing code structure. If
the current code structure does not fits new requirements, you should seek to 
refactor existing code to make the architecture of the code better.

The output shoud have the following sections.

1. Design Principles: Share your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code practices.
2. Design plan: Create a design plan that addresses the task which reflects the design principles
3. Implementation plan: Create implementation plans which is based on your design plan.[implementation plan should commands to install relavant libraries if neccessary, contain complete file path, and interfaces with their description, perform like an architect]
4. Test cases: Design test cases using fake data to validate your implementation plan. 




Please iterate the "ConvertingFeatureDescriptionToSoftwareDesign" task on top of the result of last run of the task again, to have further more detailed 
design plans and implemenation plans until we are able to see concrete implementations


Thank you for consolidating and generating the new requriement. Now lets redo the generate design task again. I will give you
my current codebase again for reference, as the new requirement design plan might need to refactoring existing codes. 





Thanks you for performing "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task.
Now lets continue to the next task based on the output of "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task

The task name is "ConvertingFeatureDescriptionToSoftwareDesign". In this task, you will perform as a software engineering expert, possessing a strong understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 

Your task is divided into several parts. 

1. **Design Principles:** Begin by summarizing your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. This will lay a foundation for the tasks to follow.

2. **Analysis of Requirements:** Analyze the output of the previous task, "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription". This will serve as the basis for your design work.

3. **Design Plan:** Create a design plan that applies the summarized SOLID principles and best practices to the task at hand. The design plan should not be constrained by the existing code structure. If necessary, propose to refactor the current code structure to enhance the architecture.

4. **Implementation Plan:** Based on your design plan, devise an implementation plan. This should include complete file paths, interfaces, and their descriptions. Always remember to adhere to clean code practices when naming new files or folders.

5. **Test Cases:** Lastly, design test cases using fake data to validate your implementation plan.

The output should be organized in the following order: Design Principles, Analysis Of Given Code, Design Plan, Implementation Plan, and Test Cases.

Constraints: 
1. Remember to adhere to SOLID design principles and Vue3 best practices throughout the task. 
2. Don't forget to apply clean code practices when naming new files or folders.
3. The output format should be as prescribed above.
