Thanks you for performing "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task.
Now lets continue to the next task based on the output of "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task

The next task name is "Converting Software Ticket To Software Design". In this task, you will perform as an expert in software engineering, with a strong understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 
Your task is to first provide a summary of your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. 


After that, you will do a step by step analysis of the requirements, you should use progressively reasoning 



you will do the design based on the output of "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task. You should apply the principles and best practices you summarized to your design. 

If your design will create new files or folders, ensure their names adhere to clean code best practices as well. 

Your design should not be limited to the provided existing code structure. If
the current code structure does not fits new requirements, you should seek to 
refactor existing code to make the architecture of the code better.

The output shoud have the following sections.

1. Design Principles: Share your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code practices.
2. Step By Step Analysis: Code Against The Goal, give your thinking process
3. Design plan: Create a design plan that addresses the task which reflects the design principles
4. Implementation plan: Create implementation plans which is based on your design plan.[implementation plan should commands to install relavant libraries if neccessary, contain complete file path, and interfaces with their description, perform like an architect]
5. Test cases: Design test cases using fake data to validate your implementation plan. 




Please iterate the "ConvertingFeatureDescriptionToSoftwareDesign" task on top of the result of last run of the task again, to have further more detailed 
design plans and implemenation plans until we are able to see concrete implementations


Thank you for consolidating and generating the new requriement. Now lets redo the generate design task again. I will give you
my current codebase again for reference, as the new requirement design plan might need to refactoring existing codes. 





Thanks you for performing "Refine And Enhance Task Description" task.
Now lets continue to the next task based on the output of "Refine And Enhance Task Description" task

The task name is "Converting Software Ticket To Software Design". In this task, you will perform as a software architect possessing a strong understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. You will analyse the output from the previous "Refine And Enhance Task Description" task, and give your design for the task which adheres to the SOLID principles and clean code principles that 
you will summarize in the "Design Principles"

The final design should be in the form of file names, classes, or functions, function descriptions etc. It just does not contain 
concret implementations.

However, Your analysis should be broken down into several steps, rather than jumping to final design in a single leap. The reasoning is similar to the following example:

'''
Example: Imagine that the task is to integrate OpenAI and Google Bard LLM API into exiting python backend

Reasoning:
based on the ticket, i will need to integrate multiple llms to python backend. Normally
the API for different LLM providers are different. But on SOLID principles, its better to
create a general abstract parent class with method...


Summary:
based on the above reasoning, the final design will conclude the following files, and interfaces

1.
filepath:src/llm_integrations/base_llm_integration.py
class: BaseLLMIntegration 
    interface: send_message(arguments)
    description:
2...
'''

Your task is divided into several parts. 

1. **Design Principles:** Begin by summarizing your knowledge of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. This will lay a foundation for the tasks to follow.

2. **Progressive Analysis:** Analyze the output of  "RefineAndEnhanceFeatureDescription" task. 
3. 

4. **Design Plan:** Create a design plan that applies the summarized SOLID principles and best practices to the task at hand. The design plan should not be constrained by the existing code structure. If necessary, propose to refactor the current code structure to enhance the architecture.

5. **Test Cases:** Lastly, design test cases using fake data to validate your implementation plan.

The output should be organized in the following order: Design Principles, Analysis Of Given Code, Design Plan, Implementation Plan, and Test Cases.

Constraints: 
1. Remember to adhere to SOLID design principles and Vue3 best practices throughout the task. 
2. Don't forget to apply clean code practices when naming new files or folders.
3. The output format should be as prescribed above.


Your will do the design based on the software ticket created by "blabla" task.
You will need to detail your understanding of the ticket, and give your reasoning process which leads to your design. The reasoning step should
apply your knowledge of expertise. I will give one example

'''
The task is about integrate multiple llm integrations into backend.
keywords: existing global config already implemented which already loaded .env

reasoning: since the requirement is to integrate multiple llm into the backend,
according to SOLID principles balbal, and clean code balbal. We can create a 
BaseLLMIntegration, and implement multiple concret classes OpenAILLMIntegrations. 

since we want to use a unified API for send information, and receive information. So we will design api send_message in BaseLLMIntegration. Each
subclass will have their own implementation


Now comes to implementing OpenAILLMIntegration. Base on my knowledge, to 
integrate openai, we have to install openai library first. OpenAI provides
create_completion api. The specification of using this API is like the following.

Since the global config already loads the .env, i just need to import this config and get the API key from the config.
...

Based on the reasoning here are all the files i will create
src/llm_integrations/BaseLLMIntegration.py 
[code]

**Task Name:** Converting Software Ticket To Software Design

**Role:** Software Architect 

**Objective:** Translate software requirements into a software design using SOLID principles and clean code best practices. The final design, which will directly become source code, should outline file names, classes, functions, and their descriptions without including concrete implementations.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Summarize Design Principles:**
    Start by summarizing the SOLID principles and clean code principles in the "Design Principles" section. As a software architect, you should have a strong understanding of these principles and be able to explain them succinctly.

2. **Perform Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA):**
    Begin by analyzing the output from the previous "Refine And Enhance Task Description" task. Identify key objects or entities from the requirements. Avoid jumping to conclusions, instead, consider the roles and responsibilities of each object.

3. **Further Analysis and Object Identification:**
    Expand on your initial analysis, delving deeper into the interactions between the identified objects. Explore how these objects relate to one another and how they contribute to fulfilling the requirement.

4. **Perform Object-Oriented Design (OOD):**
    Next, translate your analysis into a design that adheres to the summarized principles. Outline how these objects might be represented as classes or interfaces in your software, and provide file names where these classes or interfaces will reside. This design will serve as a blueprint for the source code, only without specific implementation details.

5. **Present the Design:**
    Present your design for review. This should include file names, class and function names, and their descriptions, but should not include concrete code implementations. Make sure to present it in a format that can be easily understood and reviewed.

6. **Verify and Refine the Design Against Requirements:**
    Finally, verify your design against the requirements. For each requirement, explain how the elements in your design fulfill it. If you find that some requirements are not fulfilled by the current design, revisit the relevant parts of the design and refine them until all requirements are met. 

Remember, your analysis and design should be done progressively, breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and gradually building up a complete design, rather than jumping to the final design in a single leap. This approach ensures a thorough understanding of the requirement and promotes a design that adheres to SOLID principles and clean code best practices.








Sure, I'd be happy to revise the guidelines using the heuristic, step-by-step approach. Here's how we could do it:

**Task Name:** Converting Software Ticket To Software Design

**Role:** Software Architect 

**Objective:** Translate software requirements into a software design. The final design should outline file names, classes, functions, and their descriptions without including concrete implementations, and be ready to be turned into source code. 

**Guidelines:**

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
    Start by thoroughly understanding the requirements. What is the software expected to do? What are its key features and functionalities?

2. **Identify Key Components:**
    Identify the main components or entities needed to fulfill the requirements. Don't worry about specific classes or functions yet, just think in terms of high-level components or services.

3. **Define Component Interactions:**
    Once you've identified the key components, think about how they will interact with each other. What information will they need to share? What are the dependencies between them?

4. **Design the Components:**
    For each component, start to think about what classes and functions it will need. Try to keep the SOLID principles in mind, but don't get too bogged down in them at this stage. Remember, you're not writing concrete implementations yet, just outlining what classes and functions you'll need.

5. **Refine the Design:**
    Now that you have a basic design, start refining it. Are there any parts that seem overly complex or that could be simplified? Are there any obvious improvements you could make? This is where you should start thinking more about clean code and SOLID principles.

6. **Verify Against Requirements:**
    Once you're happy with your design, verify it against the requirements. Does every requirement have a corresponding part in the design? If not, go back and revise the design until it does.

7. **Prepare for Implementation:**
    Finally, remember that your design will directly become the source code. While you're not writing concrete implementations yet, you should be preparing the design in a way that it can be easily turned into code. This means clear class and function names, precise descriptions, and an overall organization that makes sense for implementation.

This approach gives you a set of guidelines that follows a heuristic, step-by-step process, emphasizing reasoning and thought process over a more rigid structure. It should be more adaptable and flexible for different requirements and scenarios.









we have created a guideline for creating software designs from requirements. I put it here

Here is one sample example which uses step-by-step reasoning to detect errors

Example:
```
The error message indicates that the issue is caused by a TypeError: bad argument type for built-in operation. Looking at the traceback, we can see that the error originates from line 44 in grpc_service.py when trying to assign a value to stage.stage_class.

The source code suggests that stage_data["stage_class"] is being assigned to stage.stage_class, implying that stage_data["stage_class"] is not of an appropriate type for this assignment. From the traceback and the code, it appears that stage_data is expected to be a dictionary and stage_class is expected to be a key within this dictionary.

The source code provided includes a comment that explains the structure of the WORKFLOW_CONFIG dictionary. According to the comment, the 'stage_class' key should correspond to a class representing the stage. We can see in config.py that stage_class values are indeed classes such as RequirementStage, DesignStage, etc.

Given that the error is a type error, and it arises when assigning stage_data["stage_class"] to stage.stage_class, the error might be due to stage.stage_class not being able to accept a class type as its value. Instead, it may require a string representation of the class name, an instance of the class, or some other form of data.

To resolve this issue, we need to identify the correct type for stage.stage_class and convert stage_data["stage_class"] to that type before assignment. Based on common practice with gRPC, protobufs generally do not support passing around class types or instances directly. Instead, they prefer to work with basic data types such as strings and integers. Therefore, it is likely that stage.stage_class is expecting a string.

Here's a possible solution: instead of assigning the class directly, we can assign the name of the class, as a string, to stage.stage_class.
```

Now i want to give you one requirement as following
```
create a symantic index for the source code. In source code, normally, the function name , and its description together would normally represent
a general funcationality. So we can design a standard construct which will be used to generate a vector. In general, we will need to create vector. and store in vector db. Then we will also need to implement search feature given user input as query.
```

 can you use this approach to create designs?
