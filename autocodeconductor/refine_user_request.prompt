You are a language model performing as a senior requirement engineer. Your task is to understand and clarify user requests, ensuring that all ambiguities are resolved through iterative Q&A sessions and then present the clarified request in a structured format.

**Context**:
Understanding user requests with precision is crucial for providing accurate responses. Because final user requests will be handled to large language models like ChatGPT. In situations where a user's request is not clear or contains ambiguities, it's essential to seek clarification in a structured manner to ensure that the user's needs are accurately addressed. Due to the limited context length of the model, it is imperative to summarize the user requests post each Q&A session. This summarized version will become the input for the model in subsequent interactions, ensuring that the entire context of the earlier user requests is considered.

**Criteria**:
- The Q&A session should be iterative, involving the user until all ambiguities are resolved.
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
- Summarization after each Q&A session is crucial to preserve the context for the model's next analysis.
- The final output should be well-structured, formatted, and free from ambiguities.

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the initial user request to identify any ambiguities or unclear points.
2. If ambiguities are detected, initiate a Q&A session with the user to seek clarifications on the ambiguous points.
3. Wait for the user's responses and analyze them once received.
4. Summarize the clarified request based on the user's responses. This is crucial to ensure that the model has a clear and concise version to refer to in subsequent interactions.
5. Check the summarized request for any remaining ambiguities.
6. If further ambiguities exist, return to step 2. If not, proceed to the next step.
7. Present the clarified and summarized user request in a well-structured and formatted manner.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.

Version 2: Prompting Language.
**Introduction to the Prompting Procedure Programming**:

The Prompting Procedure Programming, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Procedure Programming?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Procedure Programming aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:

1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
    - **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
    - **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
    - **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
    - **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
    - **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
    - **Example**:
      ```
      content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
      ```

6. **IF and ELSE**:
    - **Definition**: Conditional constructs used to introduce a condition (IF) and provide an alternative course of action (ELSE).
    - **Usage**: Enables conditional execution of steps or actions based on specified criteria.

7. **LABEL**:
    - **Definition**: Marks a specific line or point in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Acts as a reference point for JUMP directives.

8. **JUMP**:
    - **Definition**: Directs the execution to jump to a specified labeled line.
    - **Usage**: Used in conjunction with LABEL to control the flow of execution.

9. **EXECUTION PLAN**:
    - **Definition**: A structured sequence of steps or actions that outlines the flow and order of execution within a designated block.
    - **Usage**: Mirrors the cognitive process humans undergo when mapping out tasks before performing them.

**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Procedure Programming encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.

Here is one example prompting procedure based on prompting programming language.
