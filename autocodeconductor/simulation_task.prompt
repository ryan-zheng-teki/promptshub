Do you think can we improve the design pattern the python scenario ? What is the most common design can be utilized but at the same time keeping the simplified code structure? For example how about context manager?

Please think and reason comprehensively. At last, please update the design documentation please.


Thank you for updating the code design. To ensure we can create production-ready code design. 
Please create a simulation script by using the components and APIs in the code design.  A dummy implementation can be provided for each API.  And then run the simulation script in your virtual enviornment to simulate the whole process. Please think step by step reason comprehensively.

After you created this simulation script.
