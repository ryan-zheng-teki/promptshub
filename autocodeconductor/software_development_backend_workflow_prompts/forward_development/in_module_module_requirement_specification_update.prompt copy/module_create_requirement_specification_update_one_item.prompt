As a software architect, your task is to break down the user's requirements into smaller, logically incremental, updatable units for one existing Module Requirement Specification. This ensures that each sub-requirement is created and they are internally incrementally organized.

**Context**
In software engineering, applications are divided into different modules. Over time, users might need to provide new requirements for existing module requirements. `ModuleA` is a developed module in the application which adheres to the format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section. It contains detailed module requirement specifications. `NewUserRequirement` represents the new requirement given by the user. If the user's requirement is a simple change, then it's fine. But if the user's requirement contains multiple changes, we need to break down the user's requirement into smaller, logically incremental pieces. With these smaller incremental chaanges, we we are able to apply each piece of change sequentially and incrementally.

So, the task is to analyze the user's new requirements against the existing requirement specification given in the `[ModuleRequirementSpecification]` section and break down the requirements into individual incremental pieces.

Please take a deep breath, and think step by step comprehensively to address the task. At the end of your thinking and analysis, you will put the broken-down pieces in the section [IncrementalPieces].




Version 2:
As a software architect, your task is to break down the user's requirements into smaller, logically incremental sub-requirements for analysis purposes only, for one existing Module Requirement Specification. Ensure that each sub-requirement is created, and they are internally incrementally organized. Focus solely on breaking down the user's requirement into smaller, logical pieces without considering implementation details such as code refactoring, testing, or feedback mechanisms.

**Context**
In software engineering, applications are divided into different modules. Over time, users might need to provide new requirements for the existing module requirements. `ModuleA` is an existing developed module in the application which adheres to the format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section. It contains the detailed module requirement specifications. `NewUserRequirement` represents the new requirement given by the user. When the user's requirement involves multiple changes, it is essential to break down the user's requirement into individual incremental pieces for analysis. The focus should be on analyzing and breaking down these requirements, without delving into implementation strategies, code changes, or testing procedures.

Please take a deep breath, and think step by step comprehensively to address the task of requirement analysis and breakdown only. At the end of your thinking and analysis, you will put the broken-down pieces in the section [IncrementalPieces].

### Prompt Versioning Module Requirements Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
The prompt versioning module serves as a centralized prompt management system. It offers versioning for all the entities in the application that intend to have different versions of prompts for communication with a large language model. However, communication with the large language model is not handled within this module.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. Symbols & Usage:
(Note: Since the example doesn't provide specific symbols, we are assuming generic ones based on the dependencies and usage.)
- **[⇌ Independent]**: Denotes functionalities or interactions that are managed internally without relying on other modules.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:
- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Entity can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with large language models should have a default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any external system communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented integers.


[NewUserRequirement]
Actually its not prompt versioning. It's actually prompt template versioning. So i would like to rename "prompt" to "prompt template". Here is some background: "Because what each entity in the sytem has is actually one 
prompt template. A prompt template is able to accept different parameters, then we can instantiate one prompt from the parameterized template."

[NewUserRequirement]
I have two major update 
1: Actually its not prompt versioning. It's actually prompt template versioning. So i would like to rename "prompt" to "prompt template". Here is some background: "Because what each entity in the sytem has is actually one 
prompt template. A prompt template is able to accept different parameters, then we can instantiate one prompt from the parameterized template."

2. i would like to have a more clear naming like prompt template versioning manager. So it's more clear that this module is a manager module.

As a senior software architect, your task is to plan update to existing Module Requirement specification documentation given user's new requirement.

**Context**
In software engineering, applications are divided into different modules. Overtime, user might need to provide new requirements to the existing module requirements. `ModuleA` is one existing developed module in the application. It contains the detailed module requirement 
specifications. `NewRequirement` is the new requirement given by user. So the task is to 
update the existing requirement specification based on the new user requirement. 


The requirement documentation provided in the `[ModuleA]` section, adheres to the requirement specification format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section. The specifications are listed under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" headings. Each detailed requirement specification is categorized as follows:

```
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>
   - ...
```

**Procedure**
1. Summarize your understanding of `ModuleA`
2. Detail your understanding of the user`s new requirement against the existing module requirements.
3. 


Please conduct the analysis, ensuring your reasoning is comprehensive and adheres to the required output format, especially focusing on making a singular, definitive decision.

[RequirementItem]
Category:Architecture Design Step
Requirement:Define a default prompt template for this step.


Category: Workflow Management  
Requirement: Define and manage a multi-step automated coding workflow.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement for "Workflow Management" in ModuleA, particularly the ability to define and manage a multi-step automated coding workflow, primarily focuses on the structured execution of coding tasks in a sequential or logical order. This involves initializing workflow steps, managing their progress, and ensuring the correct execution of each step or sub-step within the coding context. In contrast, ModuleB is dedicated to the versioning of prompts used in interactions with large language models. Its core functionalities revolve around managing different versions of prompts, ensuring only one effective prompt per entity at a time, and handling the dynamics of prompt versioning and database management. There is no direct functional overlap or dependency between the management of coding workflows in ModuleA and the versioning of prompts in ModuleB. While both modules may be part of the same larger system and indirectly contribute to a cohesive application, their functional responsibilities and domains are distinct and separate. ModuleB's focus on prompt versioning does not inherently involve or facilitate the management of automated coding workflows as outlined in ModuleA's requirement.
