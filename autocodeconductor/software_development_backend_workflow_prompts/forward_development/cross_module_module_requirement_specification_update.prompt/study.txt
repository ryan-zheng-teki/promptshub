Adapting to the changes introduced by the Prompt Versioning Module (Module C) can indeed be articulated in the requirements for Module A in a concise yet informative manner. Here's how you could rephrase it to reflect the current integration and system-wide protocol:

### Revised Requirement for Module A:

- **Requirement Title**: Adaptation to Centralized Prompt Management
- **Requirement Description**: 
   - **Centralized Prompt Management**: The management of prompts, including the default prompt for each step, is now centralized through the Prompt Versioning Module (Module C).
   - **Mandatory Default Prompt Definition**: In compliance with Module C’s specifications, each entity within the system, including each step in Module A, must define its own default prompt. This default prompt serves as the primary method of interaction with the large language model.
   - **Integration Highlight**: This requirement underscores the integration of Module A with the system-wide prompt management protocol established by Module C.
   - **Responsibility of Module A Steps**: Each step within Module A is responsible for defining and maintaining its default prompt in accordance with the guidelines and structure provided by Module C.

### Additional Notes:

- **Implementation Detail**: At the code level, this may involve extending from a common parent class or interface defined in Module C and overriding the method responsible for prompt definition.
- **Documentation and Communication**: Update Module A’s documentation to clearly communicate this change and its impact on existing steps. Explicitly mention the integration point with Module C for clarity.
- **Consistency Across the System**: Ensure that this approach is consistently applied across all entities within the system to maintain uniformity in prompt management.

By framing the requirement in this manner, you effectively communicate the shift in responsibility for prompt management to Module C, while clearly defining the role and responsibilities of Module A in this new structure. It helps maintain clarity in the system’s architecture and ensures a cohesive approach to prompt management across different modules.






Rewriting the requirements for Module A in light of the introduction of Module C (Prompt Versioning Module) involves clear, detailed documentation that reflects the new relationships and dependencies. Here's a structured way to approach it:

### Original Requirement for Module A:

- **Requirement Description**: Each step in Module A must define its own default prompt to communicate with the large language model.

### New Requirement for Module A with Module C Integration:

- **Requirement Title**: Integration of Prompt Versioning in Module A Steps
- **Requirement Description**: 
   - **Integration with Module C**: Each step in Module A will now integrate with Module C (Prompt Versioning Module) for managing prompt versions.
   - **Defining Default Prompts**: As per Module C’s requirements, each step must define a default prompt, which serves as the initial prompt for communication with the large language model. This default prompt is part of the prompt versioning managed by Module C.
   - **Override Mechanism**: Steps in Module A must override the 'default prompt' method as inherited from the parent class defined in Module C. This is to ensure that each step adheres to the new system-wide protocol for prompt management.
   - **Additional Prompt Specifications**: If applicable, steps must specify additional prompts as per the guidelines set by Module C. This may include alternative prompts for different scenarios or variations for testing purposes.

### Implementation Notes:

- **Code-Level Integration**: At the code level, steps in Module A will extend from the parent class in Module C. This parent class contains the structure for prompt versioning, including the abstract or virtual method for defining the default prompt.
- **Compliance with Module C Requirements**: Ensure that each step in Module A fulfills the requirement set by Module C for prompt versioning. This includes not just the definition of a default prompt but also adhering to any other prompt specifications required by Module C.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Documentation Update**: Update the technical documentation of Module A to reflect these changes. Include diagrams or flowcharts if necessary to visualize the relationship between Module A and Module C.
- **Testing and Validation**: Implement tests to ensure that the integration of Module A with Module C is functioning as expected. This includes testing the override mechanism for the default prompt and any additional prompt management features.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Consider the impact on existing functionalities within Module A and ensure that the integration with Module C does not disrupt current operations.

By structuring the requirement this way, you provide a clear, detailed understanding of how Module A now interacts with Module C, what the specific responsibilities of Module A are in this new context, and how the implementation should proceed both at the requirement and code levels. This approach helps maintain clarity and consistency across the system’s documentation and implementation.
