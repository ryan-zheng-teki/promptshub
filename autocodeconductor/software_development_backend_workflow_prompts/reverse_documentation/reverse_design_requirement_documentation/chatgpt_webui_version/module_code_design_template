### Feature Code Design Documentation:

#### 1. Code Architecture Design:

##### 1.1. High-Level Design
This feature is designed to implement the Observer Pattern, enabling multiple subscribers to be notified of certain events. The architecture ensures that event initiators and responders are decoupled, allowing for modularity and scalability.

##### 1.2. New Components Specifications

###### 1.2.1. Fully Defined

- **Publisher (New)**
    - **Purpose**: Acts as the broadcaster for events. It notifies all subscribers when an event occurs and logs them to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `subscribers_list`: List storing all the registered subscribers.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `trigger_event()`: Initiates an event, logs it, and notifies subscribers.
        - `add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)`: Adds a new subscriber to the subscribers list.
        - `log_event_to_database(event: Event)`: Logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Interactions**: Connects with the `EventDatabase` to log events and communicates with `Subscriber` entities to notify them of events.

- **Subscriber (New) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Purpose**: Monitors and responds to particular events triggered by the `Publisher`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `event_history`: List to store received events.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `on_event_received(event: Event)`: Handles the event and stores it in `event_history`.
    - **Interactions**: Receives event notifications from the `Publisher`.

###### 1.2.2. Part-Of Components (Pending File Provision)

- **NotificationService (Part-Of)) [relates Publisher]**
    - **Status Note**: _"This component is part of the feature, but its detailed specifications will be supplemented upon provision of the relevant file."_
    - **Tentative Purpose**: This service might be responsible for sending notifications to external systems or users when specific events are triggered.

##### 1.3. Used-By Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

- **EventDatabase (Used-By)**
    - **Purpose**: A database component designed to store all triggered events.
    - **Interactions**: Stores events triggered by the `Publisher`.

##### 1.4. Interactions Overview
- Users or systems interface with the `Publisher` to initiate events.
- Once an event is triggered, the `Publisher` logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
- The `Publisher` then notifies all `Subscriber` entities of this event.

##### 1.5. External Dependencies
- None.

#### 2. UML Diagram

- **UML Legend**:
  - Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this feature.
  - Components marked with `(Part-Of)` are identified but not fully defined.
  - Components marked with `(Used-By)` are pre-existing and are treated as dependencies.
