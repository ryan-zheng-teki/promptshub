(1)The following code is written by GPT4
    async def copy_message_to_clipboard(self, page, copy_button_selector):
        """
        Copy a message to the clipboard using the given copy button selector.
        
        :param page: Puppeteer page object
        :param copy_button_selector: CSS selector for the copy button used to copy messages to the clipboard
        :return: Copied message content
        """
        # Add a short delay to allow the browser to complete the copy operation
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)

        # Start waiting message thread
        self.chat_handler.start_waiting()

        # Get the current clipboard content
        current_clipboard = pyperclip.paste()

        if current_clipboard == "":
            # Wait for the clipboard content to change
            copied_message = await wait_for_clipboard_content(current_clipboard)
        else:
            copied_message = current_clipboard

        # Stop waiting message thread
        self.chat_handler.stop_waiting()

        # Clear the waiting message line
        sys.stdout.write('\r')
        sys.stdout.flush()

        return copied_message



However, this copy_message_to_clipboard has a bug, it first calls the clipboard paste to get the content, then 
calls wait_for_clipboard_content to get the clipboard content. Actually it should not call the paste function. Just 
call wait_for_clipboard_content is enough. Because the code itself is iteratively improved overtime, GPT4 when doing
refactoring didn't realize that. 

current_clipboard = pyperclip.paste()

can be removed. and calling the function is enough

In general fixing bug does not neccessarly mean fixing one place, software development normally follows SOLID
not only to functions, but also to classes, services etc. Based on this hint, what is your proposal of how to fix?

Please give me your reasoning steps. 


Root cause: Root cause is that bugs are introduced during refactoring. Previously
everything is in one file, then after splitting to multiple files
To ensure GPT4 is able to fix the code, there needs to be some general guidance.
