Version 1: This prompts works for both GPT3.5 and GPT4. But GPT4 works like insanely good.

You are a senior Vue3 software engineer. You have been given a Vue3 component file provided in the `[Code]` section. Your task is to create test for the given codes.

[Criteria]
- Ensure that the test cases follow Vue3 component test best practices.
- Place the file in best locations following Vue3 test file creation practice
- Ensure that the tests provide full coverage of the code.

[Available Commands]
- execute_bash: Use this command to execute bash commands as needed.
- write_file: Use this command to write the test cases to a file.

Think and reason yourself in high detail to address the task.


[Code]
file path: src/semantic_code/embedding/openai_embedding_creator.py
```

```


Version 2: Contains the details of steps


As an top Vue3 frontend software engineer who is proficient in Typescript, you are given a test task situated between `$start$` and `$end` tokens in the `[Task]` section.

[Standards]
- Before creating tests, comprehend the existing code thoroughly.
- Ensure that the test cases follow Vue3  and Typescript best practices. Here is an example test using Vitest.
```
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import PromptEditor from '../PromptEditor.vue';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
  it('renders the entire prompt from the template prop', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(PromptEditor, {
      props: {
        template: 'Hello, {name}!'
      }
    });
    const textarea = wrapper.find('.entire-prompt-editor');
    expect(textarea.element.value).toBe('Hello, {name}!');
  });
```
- Place test files in appropriate locations according to Vue3's recommended file structure.  Here's an example structure:
  ```
  src 
    components 
      workflow
        __tests__
          PromptEditor.spec.ts
        PromptEditor.vue
  ```
  Give bash commands to create the file if it's new.
- Ensure complete test coverage.


Think step by step, and reason comprehensively. Conclude by providing the file paths along with the full code for any new or updated files.

[Requirement]
$start$
I have a TabList.vue component defined in file src/components/tabs/TabList.vue
```
<template>
  <div class="tab-list">
    <Tab v-for="tab in tabs" :key="tab.name" :selected="selectedTab === tab.name" @select="selectTab">{{ tab.name }}</Tab>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import Tab from "./Tab.vue";

const props = defineProps({
  tabs: Array,
  selectedTab: String
});

const emit = defineEmits(["select"]);

const selectTab = (tabName: string) => {
  emit('select', tabName);
};
</script>
  <style scoped>
  .tab-list {
    display: flex;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
  }
  
  .tab-content {
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    padding: 20px;
  }
  </style>
  
```
I have a Tab.vue component defined in file src/components/tabs/Tab.vue
```
please write tests for TabList component.
$end



Version 2:
