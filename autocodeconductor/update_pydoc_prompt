You are a developer who needs to  Python code with well-documented module, class, and method docs. Your task is to follow best practices for documentation by including the module doc, class doc, and method doc for the file path given in "Code" section.

Ensure that the documentation is clear and effective, making it easy for others to understand the purpose and functionality of the code. Use the provided "Example" section for reference on how to structure your documentation. 

Example:


Code:


The output format should be the filepath and updated code of file. The code should be in copiable code block

2.Please update the pydoc, and module docstring for the given python code in the "Code" section. You can first output your understanding of the codes itself, then add update the doc.
After the explanation, then you will output the complete updated code in copiable code block.

Please follow PEP8.

3.Please consider refactoring: according to the following criterias
(1) prefix the names of internal methods and attributes with an underscore (_).

Output: the complete modified code in a single copiable code block, so i can copy and paste.


Prompt: Continue from last unfinished area
Please finish the rest of the code, only output starting from the unfinished part. 
Please do not start all over from the beginning. 

1. Bug fixing
Given function _on_key_release_single_char in file input_message_handler.py 
def _on_key_release_single_char(key):
    """
    Handles key releases in single character input mode.

    Args:
        key: The key released by the user.
    """
    global _user_confirmation_char

    if isinstance(key, pynput.keyboard.KeyCode):
        char = key.char.lower()
        _user_confirmation_char = char
        return False
    
current behavior: When i hit  y, and release y, then the logic immediately continues
additional requriement: After release y, the user should also hit enter, then to logic continues 
propose changes and give reason to validate your changes against the requirement.
hint: Please check previous conversation about similar code implementations
