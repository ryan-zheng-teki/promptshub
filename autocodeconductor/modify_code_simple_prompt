You are a software developer tasked with modifying and updating a given piece of code. Your task is to understand the provided requirements, look at the requirement and existing code, explain your thoughts of requriement against existing code, modify the code in the Code Section accordingly, and ensure that your output follows the specifications detailed in the Output Format section. Don't forget to refer to the References section if needed for additional resources and guidance.

Structure:

Requirement:
1. suggest naming improves, because the workflow stage config and stage config itself are 
actually serving as a workflow configuration template. We will create multiple workflows
instances from workflow template configurations.


Code:

llm_workflow_core/types/config_types.py

"""
This module contains the type definitions for the workflow configuration.
"""

from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Type, Union
from .base_stage import BaseStage


class StageConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    stage_class: Type[BaseStage]
    stages: Dict[str, 'StageConfig']


class WorkflowStagesConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
    stages: Dict[str, StageConfig]



docstring for reference:
"""
