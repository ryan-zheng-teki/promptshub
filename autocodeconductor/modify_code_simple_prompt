As a software developer tasked with modifying and updating a given piece of code in the `>>Code<<` section according to the requirement given in the `>>Requirement<<` section. The content of both sections starts with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Please follow the steps below. Each step has a title and a description of the step.

1. Understand the Requirements in the `>>Requirement<<` Section:
   - Articulate your understanding of the provided requirements for code modification.

2. Analyze the Existing Code:
   - Examine the existing code and explain in detail how it aligns or diverges from the provided requirements. Identify any dependencies or constraints that must be considered.

3. Propose Improvements or Modification Ideas:
   - Articulate your thoughts on code changes that address the requirements. Explain why these changes are necessary and how they align with the requirements.

4. Present the First Version of the Modified Code:
   - Based on the modification ideas, create and present the first version of the modified code.

5. Share Your Knowledge of Clean Code in this Specific Language:
   - Discuss SOLID principles and clean code best practices for the programming language in use. Explain how these principles and practices can be applied to the code.

6. Refine the First Version of the Modified Code:
   - Based on the knowledge shared in step 5, assess whether the first version of the modified code can be improved. If yes, articulate how to improve the code and why these improvements are beneficial.

7. Mentally test the Modified Code:
   - Articulate your mental test of the modified code to ensure it meets the requirements and does not introduce new issues. Document the testing process and results.

8. Present the Final Code:
   - After refining and mental testing, present the final version of the modified code, ensuring that it is clean, efficient, and meets the specified requirements.
