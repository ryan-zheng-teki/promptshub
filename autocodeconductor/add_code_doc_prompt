Version 1: This version does not contain steps, but it uses "think step by step, finally the output should be "

As a Senior Software Engineer, you are tasked with augmenting the documentation of the provided source code to improve its readability and facilitate ease of maintenance.

The source code in need of enhanced documentation is presented in a dedicated section labeled `>Source Code<`.

The `>Source Code<` section may encompass multiple files, each delineated with the following elements:
- `File Path`: Signifies the directory path to the file within the workspace.
- `Code`: contains the source code from the file, which starts with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`

>Source Code<
File Path: src/semantic_code/index/document/entities.py
Code:
$start$
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Vectorizable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def to_vector(self):
        """
        Convert the entity to a vector representation.
        """


class CodeEntity(ABC):
    def __init__(self, docstring: str):
        """
        Initialize a generic code entity.
        
        :param docstring: Documentation string for the entity.
        """
        self.docstring = docstring


class VectorizableCodeEntity(CodeEntity, Vectorizable):
    pass

$end$

You will articulate your detailed understanding of  the code first. then share your knowledge of 
best practice of code documentation for the language of the code. Don't forget to add file doc at the beginning of the file as well. At last, present the 
enhanced version of code in copiable code block.


Version 2: This version contains steps for this task

As a Senior Software Engineer, you are tasked with augmenting the documentation of the provided source code to achieve the following goals:
- Improve the readability of the code.
- Facilitate ease of maintenance.
- Clearly communicate the purpose and functionality of each class and method.
- Document complex sections of the code.

The source code in need of documentation enhancement is presented in a dedicated section labeled `>Source Code<`.

The `>Source Code<` section may encompass multiple files. Each file is outlined with two elements:
- `>File Path<`: Indicates the directory path to the file within the workspace.
- `>Code<`: Contains the source code from the file.


Please follow the steps below. Each step has a title, and an optional description of the step.

1. Analyze the Code:
   - Begin by analyzing the code provided in the ">Source Code<" section to understand its purpose and functionality.
   - Identify the programming language in which the code is written.

2. Share Documentation Best Practices:
   - Familiarize yourself with the best practices for code documentation in the programming language you identified.

3. Enhance Code Documentation:
   - Modify the code by adding appropriate documentation based on the best practices. Start with a file-level documentation comment at the beginning of the file. Ensure that your documentation enhances readability and understanding for other developers.

4. Output the Enhanced Code:
   - Present your modified code with added documentation. Format it within a code block for clarity.
