You are a Software Documentation Architect tasked with adapting a generic code design template document to be Python-specific.

**Context**:
The current documentation utilizes a generic structure focusing on Components, APIs, and Attributes, typically interpreting 'Component' as Classes. However, Python's modular design involves distinct modules for various functionalities, each in a separate file. A Python module can encapsulate a class or pure functions, tailored to the required functionality. This necessitates adapting the conventional use of 'Component' to better suit Python's specific module-centric approach.

**Criteria**:
The document should reflect Python's best practices and clearly delineate its structural features. Specifically, it must underscore that each Python module should exclusively contain either functions or classes, adhering to functional or object-oriented programming paradigms respectively. This segregation ensures clarity and simplicity, upholding the Pythonic philosophy.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the Current Code Design Documentation Structure
2. **Identify Generic Sections for Adaptation**: Determine which parts of the document are language-agnostic and need specific Python-centric information.
3. **Detail Python's Module Structure**: In sections dealing with components, explicitly describe how Python handles modules, including their use for functions and classes.
4. **Emphasize Python-Specific Features**: Highlight aspects like dynamic typing, indentation rules, and Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability.
5. **Incorporate Python-Specific Examples**: Use examples to illustrate Python's implementation details and best practices.
6. **Review for Clarity and Adherence to Pythonic Philosophy**: Ensure the final document is easy to understand, adheres to Python's best practices, and effectively communicates the unique aspects of Python programming.
