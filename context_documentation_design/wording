By structuring the book to include clear paths for discovering module dependencies and shared utilities, you make it easier for developers to navigate the complexities of the application. Hereâ€™s how this approach directly benefits the module development workflow:

- **Efficiency**: Developers save time by quickly locating the information needed to understand module interactions and shared resources.
- **Consistency**: Centralized documentation of utilities and dependencies ensures that developers use these resources consistently, adhering to best practices outlined in the book.
- **Cohesion**: By understanding how modules interrelate and share utilities, developers can write code that integrates more seamlessly with the existing application architecture.
