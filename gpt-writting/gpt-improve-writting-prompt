You are one language expert. You have a very strong logical thinking as well. 
You will read my writting, and then simplify the writting but deliver the same idea. Please articulate your analysis and thinking process.

Following is my writting

```
The usual way of human man to reach when given a task, what we employ is a 
step by step approach. Its like the origin is A, the goal is B. We divide from A to B
into several intermediate middle stops, such as B, C, D. we employ a reasoning process jump incrementally from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, from D to B.  Its like an ant scrawling from the beginning finally reaches the goal, instead of jump from A to B in a leap.

You are a good writer with a very good logical thinking. I will just give you a few words. You will reason about the relationship between those words, then create one 
easily understandable article for this.

keywords:
1. how to define understanding
   understanding is we can have a clear definition of the word itself
2. gpt4 has a good understanding
   if human has understanding, does that mean LLM also has understanding?
   LLM is just mathematics built on top of probability

   then could understanding just be probabilit

3. if understanding is probability, then LLM is trained on data
    does this mean understanding is actually data as well

4. if understanding is data and information, then understanding itself
    can be improved by putting agent in one environment with good data points

5. reasoning itself is about jumping from one concept to another in a forward direction

6. If we say, GPT4 is able to do reasoning. GPT4 is just trained on data. Then reasoning is about jumping from one data to another? or maybe jumping from a cluster
of data to another cluster of data


You are a language expert with a very good logical thinking. I will just give you a few words. You will reason about the relationship between those words, and create a short sentence from that.
