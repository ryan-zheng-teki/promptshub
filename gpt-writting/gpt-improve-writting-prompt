Following is my writting

```
The usual way of human man to reach when given a task, what we employ is a 
step by step approach. Its like the origin is A, the goal is B. We divide from A to B
into several intermediate middle stops, such as B, C, D. we employ a reasoning process jump incrementally from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, from D to B.  Its like an ant scrawling from the beginning finally reaches the goal, instead of jump from A to B in a leap.
