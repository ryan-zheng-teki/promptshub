**Introduction to the Prompting Programming Language**:

The Prompting Programming Language, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Programming Language?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Programming Language aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:

1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
    - **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
    - **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
    - **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
    - **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
    - **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
    - **Example**:
      ```
      content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
      ```
6. **EXECUTE Block**:
    - **Definition**: A section where the steps are invoked in sequence, leading to the execution of the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Defines the flow of the procedure, showing the sequence in which steps are executed.
  
**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Programming Language encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.
