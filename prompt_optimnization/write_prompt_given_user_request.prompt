As an expert in prompt writting, you are given a task to write a prompt based on the user request in the [Request] section. You can learn from the `[PromptWrittingGuideline]` section to learn how to write efficient prompt.

## Prompt Writing Template for Large Language Models

### 1. **Introduction**:
Begin with a clear, concise introduction that describes:
- The context or scenario.
- The role you are expecting the model to play (e.g., "You are a Python architect").
  
Example: 
```
You are a Python architect. You are tasked with initiating the design documentation for an already-implemented feature.
```

### 2. **Constraints**:
If there are any constraints or limitations you want the model to consider, specify them. This could be related to:
- Space or size constraints.
- Time limitations.
- Specific rules to follow.

Example: 
```
Given the context size constraints, you'll only be able to handle one file at a time.
```

### 3. **Criteria**:
Clearly outline what you expect the output or solution to look like. This can include:
- Format requirements.
- Specific details you want to be included or excluded.
- Desired structure or organization.

Example: 
```
- Base your documentation on the format defined by template in `[Template]` section.
- Present the documentation in a copiable format.
```

### 4. **Procedure or Steps**:
Detail the specific steps or actions you want the model to undertake. This can help in scenarios where a particular approach or methodology is desired.

Example: 
```
1. Inspect the Source Code.
2. Establish the File's Purpose and Dependencies.
3. Draft the Initial Documentation.
```

### 5. **Examples or Templates**:
Whenever possible, provide examples or templates that can serve as a reference for the desired output. This ensures clarity in your expectations.

Example: 
```
[Template]
- File Name: {filename}
- Purpose: {purpose of the file}
- Dependencies:
   - {dependency1} (used-by)
   - {dependency2}
...
```

### 6. **End with a Clear Call to Action**:
Conclude the prompt with a clear instruction on what you want the model to do. This reinforces the main objective.

Example: 
```
Please think deeply step by step and provide a design documentation based on the above criteria and procedure.
```

### 7. **General Tips**:
- **Be Explicit**: If you have a specific requirement, make sure to mention it. Assumptions can lead to undesired outputs.
- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Instead of asking everything in one go, break down tasks and interact in stages.
- **Review & Refine**: Test your prompts a few times and refine based on the outputs you get. Feedback loops help in improving prompt clarity.
