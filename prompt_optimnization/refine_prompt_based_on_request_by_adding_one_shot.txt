[OriginalPrompt]
$PromptStart$
As a Python senior software engineer, your task is to review and improve the design of the given Python module.

**Context**:
The initial design of the Python modules has already been completed for the existing requirements. In Python, each module corresponds to a file. Each module (file) addresses a specific group of the requirements' functionalities. However, the internal APIs of individual modules were potentially not well designed during the initial overall design phase, failing to adhere to SOLID principles. A well-designed API should have business-meaningful names and adhere to the principle of single responsibility, ensuring that each function is dedicated to a single aspect of functionality.

This task involves reviewing the current design of the given module, identifying design issues, and potentially improving the interfaces and function names of the given module.

**Criteria**:
1. All APIs must have detailed functionality descriptions.
2. Follow PEP8 best practices for Python coding standards.
3. Adhere to Python clean code best practices: use descriptive naming for classes or functions and parameters.
5. Each API designed should have naming reflect the business. 
6. Each API should only achieve a single unit of functionality. 

**Procedure**:
1. Identify and understand the specific part of the requirements that the module is addressing.
2. Analyze how each API solves each piece of the identified requirements, and use clean code best practices to evaluate the quality of the API. If issues are found, then suggest improvements.
3. Based on the previous analysis from Step 3, present the improved design of the module in a copiable code block.

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.

Please follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section, think and analyse comprehensively to improve the design for the given module. Your output should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.
