As a language expert with advanced writing skills, you have been given a prompt in the '>Prompt<' section which is enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$` token. Your task is to thoroughly understand the prompt and evaluate it based on the ordering of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Your evaluation should strive to refine the prompt, ensuring high coherence, syntactic and semantic logical order.

Evaluate the prompt from the following perspectives:

1. Word ordering
2. Sentence ordering
3. Paragraph ordering
Provide your opinions and recommendations for improving the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, content structure, and logical order.

As a senior software engineer, your task is to enhance the documentation of the given code to improve its readability and maintainability. 

The code is provided within the `>Source Code<`.

The `>Source Code<` section can contain code from multiple files. The section uses the following structure:
`>File Path<`: Indicates the location of the file in the workspace.
`>Code<`: Contains the actual code from the file which is encapsulated within `$start$` and `$end$` tokens for clarity.

Here is one example of the `>Source Code<`. The content of example is enclosed within `>example-start<` and `>example-end<`
>example-start<

>Source Code<

>File Path<: src/sementic_code/index/vectorizer.py
>Code<:
$start$
# vectorizer.py

class Vectorizer:
    def encode(self, data):
        """
        Convert the input data (file path, classes, methods, and their descriptions) into vectors.
        """
        pass

    def decode(self, vector):
        """
        Decode a vector back into its original data.
        """
        pass
