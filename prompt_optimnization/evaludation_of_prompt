[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features.

[OriginalPrompt]
$PromptStart$
You are a senior Python software developer. Your objective is to analyze user requirements and set up a foundational working development environment for a Python backend application, ensuring it is well-organized and adheres to best practices for the specific application being developed.

**Context**:
The process of setting up a Python backend application begins with a thorough analysis of user requirements. This analysis helps in determining the type of application being developed, which is crucial for the subsequent setup of the necessary environments. For instance, the realization that the application is a Python backend prompts the identification of a suitable framework, such as Flask or FastAPI. This initial stage involves establishing foundational libraries and file structures based on the best practices of the identified framework:

- For a Flask application, this might entail setting up files like `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and a `templates` folder.
- In a FastAPI application, this includes `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `uvicorn`, and a `models` directory.

Following this, the second stage of the setup focuses on integrating additional libraries required to meet specific business needs of the application. This means tailoring the environment beyond the typical framework requirements to address unique business functionalities and requirements.

The completion of these two stages results in a fully operational development environment, ready for the implementation and development of the specific business requirements.

**Criteria**:
- Set up a backend application structure that is organized and follows best practices.
- Include all necessary libraries and structures, both foundational and business-specific.


**Procedure**:
1. Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.
2. Analyze the requirements to identify libraries needed specific to the business needs of the application, tailoring the environment to these unique requirements.
3. Based on previous analysis, create a single block of Bash commands in a dependency-resolved order in a copiable text format.


**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step objective, formatting each step with the exact title as specified in the procedure, and ensuring the output of each step reflect the continuous and detailed analytical nature of human thought process to achieve the objetive of the step, while maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.

if you look at the step 3 output 

```
# Create a project directory
mkdir my_fastapi_project
cd my_fastapi_project

# Set up a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

both the project directory and environment name is not really ideal. We should have meaningful names for the environment and root project names.

I think we should enhance the Criteria section.

[Output]
$start$
### Step 1: Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.

Given the user requirements, the application appears to be a Python server application with a focus on web scraping, automation, and media handling. The application needs to be highly responsive and capable of handling asynchronous tasks effectively, such as navigating web pages and monitoring for changes over extended periods. This leads me to choose FastAPI as the most suitable framework for this project. FastAPI provides robust support for asynchronous operations, which is essential for web scraping and continuous monitoring tasks. 

The foundational environment setup for a FastAPI application typically includes:

- **main.py**: The entry point of the application. Here, we'll define the FastAPI app instance, route declarations, and the main logic for the server's operation.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the necessary Python libraries. For this project, this will include FastAPI, uvicorn (an ASGI server for FastAPI), Puppeteer (for web scraping), playsound (for playing the notification sound), and any other dependencies.
- **config.json**: As specified, this file will contain configurable parameters like the country, notification music path, and CSS selector values.
- **models**: A directory to define data models, which can help in validating the structure of `config.json` and any other structured data we handle.
- **utils**: A directory for utility scripts, such as the one handling the web scraping and navigation logic.
- **logs**: A folder for storing log files, specifically for error logs as per the requirement.

This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain. It also aligns with FastAPI's best practices and accommodates the specific functionalities required by the application.

### Step 2: Analyze the requirements to identify libraries needed specific to the business needs of the application, tailoring the environment to these unique requirements.

The user requirements necessitate a selection of specialized libraries and tools to meet the specific business needs:

- **Puppeteer**: Essential for automating browser-based tasks, like navigating web pages and interacting with web elements. This library is critical for fulfilling the web scraping and navigation requirements.
- **playsound**: Required for playing a notification sound when an appointment is found. This library meets the user's need for an auditory alert.
- **FastAPI**: Chosen for its asynchronous support and ease of use, this framework is ideal for setting up a responsive and efficient backend server.
- **Uvicorn**: As an ASGI server, Uvicorn will serve the FastAPI application. It's necessary for running the application in production.
- **Python's built-in logging module**: This will be used for creating timestamped log files, ensuring robust error handling and debugging capabilities.
- **Additional libraries for HTTP requests, JSON handling, and date/time operations**: Libraries like `requests`, `json`, and `datetime` might be necessary for handling HTTP requests, parsing JSON files, and managing time-related operations, respectively.

These libraries and tools are selected to efficiently address the specific functionalities such as web scraping, UI interaction, asynchronous processing, and logging, which are central to the application's business requirements.

### Step 3: Based on previous analysis, create a single block of Bash commands in a dependency-resolved order in a copiable text format.

```bash
# Create a project directory
mkdir my_fastapi_project
cd my_fastapi_project

# Set up a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Install Puppeteer for Python
pip install pyppeteer

# Install playsound for audio playback
pip install playsound

# Create the basic file structure
touch main.py requirements.txt
mkdir models utils logs

# Write dependencies to requirements.txt
echo "fastapi==[SPECIFY_VERSION]" > requirements.txt
echo "uvicorn==[SPECIFY_VERSION]" >> requirements.txt
echo "pyppeteer==[SPECIFY_VERSION]" >> requirements.txt
echo "playsound==[SPECIFY_VERSION]" >> requirements.txt

# Note: Replace [SPECIFY_VERSION] with the specific versions as needed.
```

This Bash script sets up the initial development environment tailored to our FastAPI application. It creates a project directory, sets up a Python virtual environment, installs necessary dependencies (ensuring version control for each library), and establishes the basic directory and file structure. This script is a foundational step, allowing developers to start implementing the specific functionalities outlined in the user requirements.
