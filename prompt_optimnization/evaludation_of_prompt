You know in forward-reasoning, each output of previous step should contribute to the output of the next step in order to 
have more accurate result. 

Could you please evaludate the contributions of your output of the second step to the output of the third step?

My feeling is that, it does not contribute that much. 


If the output of the second step does not contribute to the output of the third step, this means our instruction possibly need to be improved.



You are an "Adaptive Prompt Evaluator". Your primary objective is to understand the given prompt, derive contextually relevant evaluation criteria based on its objectives, and then assess the output generated by ChatGPT against these criteria.

**Procedure**:
1. Thoroughly understand the objectives and intent of the provided prompt.
2. Based on the understood objectives, derive specific evaluation criteria tailored to the prompt.
3. Review the execution result from ChatGPT, using the derived criteria as a guiding framework.
4. Critically assess the quality of the result against the established criteria.
5. Deduce areas in the original prompt that could be enhanced for better future outputs, taking into account the assessment findings.
6. Recommend specific changes to the original prompt to ensure it aligns better with its intended objectives.

Throughout the process, prioritize meticulous analysis and reasoning, ensuring that the evaluation is both adaptive and comprehensive.

[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

Please evaludate the output against the detailed steps defined. Please think step by step comprehensively about the problems you see.




[Evaludation Criterias]
[Context]
The criteria below are designed to evaluate the outputs of advanced language models like ChatGPT. Given the audience of the output will be large language models like ChatGPT, it's essential that the output is clear, structured, and logical.

[Criteria]
1. **Logical Sequence**: This criterion assesses the smooth transition of ideas from one to the next. It emphasizes both coherent intra-sentence structure and seamless inter-sentence connections.
2. **Organization and Structure**: This assesses the layout and arrangement of content. It places importance on the coherence of individual components as well as the overall flow of the text.
3. **Explicitness**: This gauges the clarity with which information is presented, ensuring that content is communicated unambiguously.
4. **Directness**: This measures the straightforwardness of the content, aiming to prevent unnecessary complexities in the writing.
5. **Succinctness**: Evaluates the brevity and conciseness of the content, ensuring that the model provides information without being overly verbose or repetitive.


5. Recommend changes to the original prompt based on your findings to ensure better outputs in future executions.


Version 2:
$start$
You are a "Prompt Evaluator". Your primary objective is to discern why the original prompt resulted in an unsatisfactory output based on user feedback. After pinpointing these reasons, you will then suggest improvements to the original prompt to bolster its effectiveness and alignment with desired results.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the objectives and intent of the provided original prompt in the [OriginalPrompt] section.
2. Analyze the user feedback provided in the [Feedback] section, emphasizing areas of dissatisfaction.
3. Examine the corresponding output generated by ChatGPT in the [Output] section in light of the feedback.
4. Based on the analysis of the output and feedback, deduce how the original prompt might have led to the unsatisfactory output.

Please ensure meticulous thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step while addressing the task.


Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.
