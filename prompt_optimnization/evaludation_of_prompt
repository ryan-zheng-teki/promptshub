[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

ChatGPT: **Node: Analyze the initial user request**

Alright, let's break down this request. The user wants to create a job website aimed at Chinese developers, focusing on job opportunities in European countries. This is a great start, but there are a few points I'm unsure about. For instance, what specific features does the user want on the website? Are they looking for basic job listings, or something more advanced like integration with LinkedIn or a CV builder? Also, it's not clear what level of support or resources the user has for this project – are they a solo entrepreneur or do they have a team? Understanding their technical background and resources will help tailor the advice.

So, here's where I am: I understand the main concept of the request, but I need more details on the website's features and the user's background and resources. It's time to engage in a Q&A session to clarify these points.

Moving to the next step - let's get some clarifications from the user.

User:
Let's build the MVP first. And since you are the requirement engineer now. I trust you can use your reasoning to find the best options for these questions you raised

ChatGPT:
**Node: Initiate a Q&A session for clarification**

Got it, we're focusing on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the job website. This simplifies things. Since I'm taking on the role of a requirements engineer, I'll use my reasoning to address the questions I raised and make some educated guesses for clarification.

1. **Website Features for MVP**: For an MVP, the essential features might include basic job listings, a simple search function, and perhaps user account creation for job seekers. Advanced features like LinkedIn integration or CV builders could be part of a later phase.

2. **User's Technical Background and Resources**: Since there's no specific information provided, I'll assume the user has some basic understanding of website development but might not be an expert. Therefore, recommendations should be user-friendly and not require advanced technical skills. If the user has a team or external support, they can be more ambitious with features, but for an MVP, it's best to keep it simple.

3. **Target Audience and Market Research**: The target audience is clearly Chinese developers looking for jobs in Europe. However, understanding the specific needs and preferences of this audience is crucial. I'll assume some market research might be needed to tailor the job listings and website design to this audience.

Summarizing, the MVP will focus on essential job listing features, suited for someone with basic web development skills, and targeted at Chinese developers seeking European jobs. Next, I'll analyze these assumptions and proceed to structure the clarified request.

User:
Please continue

ChatGPT:
**Node: Analyze user's response**

Based on our current understanding and assumptions:

1. **MVP Features**: The MVP will include basic but essential features like job listings, a simple search function, and user account creation for job seekers. These are manageable for someone with basic web development skills and provide a solid foundation.

2. **Technical Background and Resources**: Assuming a basic level of expertise in web development, the focus should be on using user-friendly development tools and platforms. This could include website builders like WordPress or Wix, which offer customizable job board themes and plugins. If more advanced features are needed in the future, they can consider hiring a developer or learning more advanced skills.

3. **Target Audience**: The target audience, Chinese developers seeking jobs in Europe, suggests the need for a bilingual interface (Chinese and English), a focus on tech jobs, and possibly some resources or information about working in Europe.

So, this is where we are: We have a clearer picture of the MVP, the user's likely technical capability, and the target audience's needs. The next step is to summarize this clarified request and present it in a structured format. Let's do that.

User: 
Please
