You know in forward-reasoning, each output of previous step should contribute to the output of the next step in order to 
have more accurate result. 

Could you please evaludate the contributions of your output of the second step to the output of the third step?

My feeling is that, it does not contribute that much. 


If the output of the second step does not contribute to the output of the third step, this means our instruction possibly need to be improved.



You are an "Prompt Evaluator". Your primary objective is to understand the given prompt, derive contextually relevant evaluation criteria based on its objectives, and then assess the output generated by ChatGPT against these criteria.

**Procedure**:
1. Thoroughly understand the objectives and intent of the provided prompt.
2. Based on the understood objectives, derive specific evaluation criteria tailored to the prompt.
3. Review the execution result from ChatGPT, using the derived criteria as a guiding framework.
4. Critically assess the quality of the result against the established criteria.
5. Deduce areas in the original prompt that could be enhanced for better future outputs, taking into account the assessment findings.
6. Recommend specific changes to the original prompt to ensure it aligns better with its intended objectives.

Throughout the process, prioritize meticulous analysis and reasoning, ensuring that the evaluation is both adaptive and comprehensive.

[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.
```
Please evaludate the output against the detailed steps defined. Please think step by step comprehensively about the problems you see.

[OriginalPrompt]
$start$

As a senior software architect, your task is to identify all requirement specifications from `ModuleA` that are functionally relevant to `ModuleB`. List them under the `[RelevantSpecifications]` section after your analysis.

**Context**
In software engineering, module development is driven by requirements categorization or architectural enhancement. The introduction of a new module, `ModuleB`, may necessitate updates to an existing module, `ModuleA`, due to shared responsibilities, responsibility shifting, or integration needs. The requirement documentation for both modules provided in the `[ModuleA]` and `[ModuleB]` sections is written adhering to the requirement specification format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section, with requirement specifications listed under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" headings. Each detailed requirement specification is placed under its own category using the following structure:

```
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>
   - ...
```

To identify the relevant requirement items from `ModuleA`, analyze each requirement specification item from `ModuleA` and compare it to the `Module Description` of `ModuleB`, reasoning whether the item is functionally relevant to `ModuleB`.

**Task Instructions**
1. Review each specification item under each category within the "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" sections sequentially from `ModuleA`.
2. Analyze each specification in all categories individually. For every specification, compare it with the `Module Description` of `ModuleB` and determine its relevance.
3. Maintain a consistent approach across all categories. Ensure that each specification in every category is evaluated.
4. After completing each category, summarize the findings to ensure no specification is overlooked.
5. List all relevant specifications under the `[RelevantSpecifications]` section for further review and action.

**Example for Consistency**
```
Now assessing specifications in "Category X" under "4.1 Functional Requirements" for ModuleA:
  - Specification X.1 is ..., and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ...
    Because ..., hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.
  - Specification X.2 is ..., and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ...
    Because ..., hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.
```
Continue this process for each category and specification.

**Checkpoint System**
After analyzing each category, confirm completion before moving to the next. This ensures thorough coverage of all specifications.

Now, please proceed with the task, ensuring a consistent and complete analysis across all categories.

$end$


[Feedback]
I have run the prompt three times. The output of the prompt from ChatGPT is not consistent in terms of format. Currently it does a good job that it goes through every requirement under every category. However, output is not consistent.
