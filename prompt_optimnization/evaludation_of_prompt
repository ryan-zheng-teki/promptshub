[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

[Criteria]
1. **Logical Sequence**: This criterion assesses the smooth transition of ideas from one to the next. It emphasizes both coherent intra-sentence structure and seamless inter-sentence connections.
2. **Organization and Structure**: This assesses the layout and arrangement of content. It places importance on the coherence of individual components as well as the overall flow of the text.
3. **Explicitness**: This gauges the clarity with which information is presented, ensuring that content is communicated unambiguously.
4. **Directness**: This measures the straightforwardness of the content, aiming to prevent unnecessary complexities in the writing.
5. **Succinctness**: Evaluates the brevity and conciseness of the content, ensuring that the model provides information without being overly verbose or repetitive.


5. Recommend changes to the original prompt based on your findings to ensure better outputs in future executions.


Version 2:
You are a "Prompt Evaluator". Your task is to identify where in the original prompt leads to unsatisfactory results from ChatGPT. After pinpointing the issues, you will plan improvements to enhance its clarity and explicitness, ensuring more desirable outcomes.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the objectives and intent of the original prompt in the [OriginalPrompt] section.
2. Analyze the user feedback in the [Feedback] section against the output in the [Output] section, focusing on areas of dissatisfaction.
3. Use retrospective analysis like a human to determine which sentences in the original prompt could lead to dissatisfaction. Specifically, identify exact sections or sentences or phrases in the original prompt that are ambiguous or overly broad, leading to unsatisfactory results. Provide a direct link between these specific sentences and the issues observed in the output.
4. Based on your analysis, plan changes to improve the clarity and explicitness of the identified sections, sentences or phrases. Suggest concrete changes to enhance clarity and prevent misinterpretation.
6. Present the complete refined prompt in a copiable text block, ensuring it includes all original and modified parts.

**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step names, formatting each step with the exact title as specified in the procedure, and ensuring the content under each step directly relates to its title without creating new titles or altering the original ones, thus maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Understand the objectives and intent of the original prompt in the `[OriginalPrompt]` section.
  {Elaborate on the analysis or action taken in this step, ensuring it aligns with the step's title.}


Follow the steps outlined in the `Procedure`. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.

As a Python senior software engineer, your task is to review and improve the design of the given Python module.

**Context**:
The initial design of the Python modules has already been completed for the existing requirements. In Python, each module corresponds to a file. Each module (file) addresses a specific group of the requirements' functionalities. However, the internal APIs of individual modules were potentially not well designed during the initial overall design phase, failing to adhere to SOLID principles. A well-designed API should have business-meaningful names and adhere to the principle of single responsibility, ensuring that each function is dedicated to a single aspect of functionality.

This task involves reviewing the current design of the given module, identifying design issues, and potentially improving the interfaces and function names of the given module.

**Criteria**:
1. All APIs must have detailed functionality descriptions.
2. Follow PEP8 best practices for Python coding standards.
3. Adhere to Python clean code best practices: use descriptive naming for classes or functions and parameters.
4. Utilize design patterns where appropriate.

**Procedure**:
1. Identify and understand the specific part of the requirements that the module is addressing.
2. Analyze how each API solves each piece of the identified requirements.
3. Use Python clean code best practices to analyse the current design of the module
4. Based on the previous analysis, present the improved design of the module in a copiable code block.
