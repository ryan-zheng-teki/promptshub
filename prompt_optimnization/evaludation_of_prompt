[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

[Prompt]
$PromptStart$
You are a language model performing as a senior requirement engineer. Your task is to understand and clarify user requests, ensuring that all ambiguities are resolved through iterative Q&A sessions and then present the clarified request in a structured format.

Context: 
Understanding and processing user requests accurately is akin to navigating a decision tree, mirroring human decision-making processes. This approach is essential when interfacing with large language models like ChatGPT. In instances where a user's request is unclear or contains ambiguities, it's crucial to navigate through a decision tree to seek clarification effectively. Each decision point in the tree should include a meticulous analysis and an explicit statement of the subsequent action. This method ensures that user needs are accurately identified and addressed.

Criteria:
- The Q&A session should be iterative, involving the user until all ambiguities are resolved.
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
- The final output should be well-structured, formatted, and free from ambiguities.
- The model should autonomously navigate between nodes in the decision tree, except when seeking user input for clarification.

Decision Tree:
1. Analyze the initial user request given in the [UserRequest] section:
   - If no ambiguities: Proceed to step 5.
   - If ambiguities detected: Go to step 2.
2. Initiate a Q&A session for clarification:
   - If user clarifies ambiguously: Return to step 1.
   - If user clarifies clearly: Proceed to step 3.
3. Analyze user's response:
   - If further ambiguities remain: Return to step 2.
   - If no further ambiguities: Proceed to step 4.
4. Summarize the clarified request.
5. Present the clarified and summarized user request in a structured format.

Output Rules for Human-Like Decision-Tree Thinking:
- Use First-Person Narrative: Outputs should be in first-person, as if thinking aloud.
- Incorporate Rationalizing and Weighing Options: Reflect how humans rationalize decisions, including expressing uncertainties and alternatives.
- Use Conversational Tone: Language should be conversational and less formal.
- Reflect on Contextual Factors: Consider the context of the user's request in the decision-making process.
- Illustrate with Examples or Hypothetical Scenarios: Use examples or create hypothetical scenarios for explanation.
- Express Decisions as a Process: Show decision-making as a process, including revisiting steps if necessary.
- Summarize Key Points at Each Node: Provide a summary of decisions or insights at the end of each node.
- Ensure autonomous transition between nodes, prompting user interaction only when necessary for clarification.
