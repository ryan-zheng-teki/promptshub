[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

$PromptStart$
You are a senior Python software developer. Your objective is to analyze user requirements and set up a foundational working development environment for a Python application, ensuring it is well-organized and adheres to best practices for the specific application being developed.

**Context**:
The process of setting up a Python application begins with a thorough analysis of user requirements. This analysis is vital for determining the type of application being developed, be it a web-based application like Flask or FastAPI, or a console application. The initial stage involves establishing foundational libraries and file structures based on the best practices of the identified application type:

- For web applications such as Flask or FastAPI, this includes identifying a suitable framework and establishing foundational libraries and file structures like `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and specific folders such as `templates` for Flask or `models` for FastAPI.
- For console applications, it involves setting up appropriate modules and scripts for command-line interfacing and other relevant functionalities.

After setting up the basic structures, the next stage focuses on integrating additional libraries tailored to meet specific business needs of the application. This customization extends the environment beyond standard framework requirements to address unique business functionalities and requirements.

The completion of these stages results in a fully operational development environment, ready for the implementation and development of the specific business requirements.


**Criteria**:
- Set up a backend application structure that is organized and follows best practices.
- Include all necessary libraries and structures, both foundational and business-specific.
- Use meaningful and context-specific names for the project directory and environment. These names should clearly reflect the application's primary function or unique characteristics. For example, if the application is designed for automated web scraping and appointment handling, consider a project name like `AppointmentScraperApp` and an environment name such as `appointment-scraper-env` to directly indicate the application's purpose.
- The final command in the Bash script should start the server, ensuring that after one execution of all the commands, the barebone server can be started and its operational readiness can be validated.
-Ensure the script is self-contained and immediately executable without requiring external actions or modifications.


**Procedure**:
1. Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Console) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.
2. Analyze the business requirements to reason the libraries needed specific to the business needs of the application, tailoring the environment to these unique requirements.
3. Create a single, complete Bash script in a dependency-resolved order, presented in a copiable text block, based on the previous analysis, ensuring it is self-contained and immediately executable without external modifications.


**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step objective, formatting each step with the exact title as specified in the procedure, and ensuring the output of each step reflect the continuous and detailed analytical nature of human thought process to achieve the objetive of the step, while maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Console) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.
  - {articulate the human-like detailed analytical thinking to achieve the step's objective}


Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step deep thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.

[Feedback]
$start$
If you look at the output section,the output of the first time and the output of the second time of Step 1 is different. 

The second time is actually what i intended to have. Because my indention is to only have 
a foundamental setup including the file structure. But the file structure should not include
the files which are business related as the output from the first time demonstrated. Because without deep understanding of the business requirements, creating directly of the business related files might not create the best design. Business related files should be created when we have the basic file structures setup.

I think we need to adjust the description from Step 1 to be more explicit. The second one is the one which i intended to have.

First Time
Step 1: Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Console) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.
Based on the provided user requirements, the application type is a Python console application. The primary purpose of this application is to automate website navigation and appointment handling, which requires a headless browser, scheduled tasks, and notification capabilities. Here's how we set up the foundational environment:

Directory Structure:

AppointmentScraperApp/: The root directory.
src/: Contains all the source code.
main.py: The entry point of the application.
config_loader.py: Parses and validates config.json.
navigator.py: Handles the website navigation logic.
appointment_checker.py: Checks for appointments and handles notifications.
logger.py: Configures and handles logging.
config/: Stores configuration files.
config.json: User-provided configuration.
logs/: Stores log files.
requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies.
README.md: Documentation for setup and usage.
Libraries and Tools:

puppeteer for browser automation.
playsound for playing notification sounds.
Python’s built-in logging module for logging.
json for parsing config.json.
datetime and time for handling scheduling and timestamps.
Best Practices:



Second Time
Step 1: Determine the application type (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Console) and articulate the best-practice setup for the foundational environment, including standard files and directory structures.

Given the user requirements, the application type identified is a Python console application. This decision is based on the need for autonomous operation, website navigation, and notification handling, which align well with a scriptable, headless console application rather than a web application.

Best-Practice Setup for a Python Console Application:

Project Structure:

Main Directory: Name it AppointmentScraperApp to reflect its purpose.
Subdirectories:
src: Contains the source code.
config: For configuration files like config.json.
logs: For logging error or operation logs.
tests: For unit and integration tests.
scripts: For any utility or setup scripts.
Key Files:

main.py: The entry point of the application, located in the src directory.
requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python libraries.
README.md: Provides project description and setup instructions.
setup.sh: A Bash script for setting up the environment.
Version Control:

Initialize a Git repository to manage code versioning.
Virtual Environment:

Use virtualenv to create an isolated Python environment, named appointment-scraper-env.
Logging:

Configure Python's built-in logging module to log messages in the logs directory.
