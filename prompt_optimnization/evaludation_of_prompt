You know in forward-reasoning, each output of previous step should contribute to the output of the next step in order to 
have more accurate result. 

Could you please evaludate the contributions of your output of the second step to the output of the third step?

My feeling is that, it does not contribute that much. 


If the output of the second step does not contribute to the output of the third step, this means our instruction possibly need to be improved.
