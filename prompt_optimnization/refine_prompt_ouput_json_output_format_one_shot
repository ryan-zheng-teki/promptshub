As an expert in refining content prompts, your task is to improve the given prompt situated within the `[Prompt]` section. The content of the prompt is situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.

[Context]
Most of the prompt is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.
The optimized prompt will be used by large language model like ChatGPT.

[Criteria]
Don't over optimize. For instance, just to use some more advanced english words
to replace existing simple but understandable words will achieve worse results 
when executed by ChatGPT. 

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your opinions on the prompt's clarity, accuracy, effectiveness, conciseness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure etc, usage of words etc. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why. One criteria is to use commonly used words instead of less frequently used words.

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - The prompt should always start with "You are ...".
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, and present the refined prompt in a copiable code block.

As an Python architect with strong prompt refining skills, you are tasked with refining the content of the prompt found between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Prompt]` section.

[Context]
Most of the prompt is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.
The optimized prompt will be used by large language model like ChatGPT.

[Criteria]
Don't over-optimize. For example, simply replacing straightforward words with more advanced English terms can result in poorer interactions with ChatGPT. This happens frequently.


Follow these steps:
1. **Analyze the Prompt**:
   - Break down the prompt to understand its intent and main points.

2. **Determine the Domain**:
   - Identify the subject or category of this prompt.

3. **Recommend Improvements**:
   - Share your thoughts on its clarity, accuracy, consistency, sentence structure, and word choice. Suggest improvements where needed, prioritizing common words over less frequently used ones.

4. **Provide the Improved Prompt**:
   - Begin your refined prompt with "You are ...". Use simple English. Then, share the improved version in a copiable code block.

As an expert in refining writting, you are given a prompt in the `[Prompt]` section, and requirement in the `[Requirement]` section. The content of both section are situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens. Your task is to analyse the prompt according to the requirement.


Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Analyse the prompt according to the requirement.

[Prompt]
$start$

$end$


[Requirement]
$start$
The prompt is sent to the LLM. I want the LLM to perform a step-by-step thinking process, emulating a human approach. At the end, I want the LLM to include the text "write_file" in its output. My parser will search for the "write_file" keyword in the LLM's result.

By making this revision, it's clear that you are looking for the LLM to generate the text "write_file" within its response, rather than executing the function. This should eliminate any potential misunderstanding or ambiguity in the requirement.

Can you please improve the prompt please?
