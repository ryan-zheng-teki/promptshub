2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, 4, and present the refined prompt from a new line

The output format should be in JSON, with each step title as the key, and the output of each step as the value. Here is an example format:
   {   
       "Analyze the Prompt": "Description of analysis...",
       "Summarize the Prompt": "Concise summary...",
