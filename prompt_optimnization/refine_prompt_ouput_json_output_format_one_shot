Prompt Description: This prompt is used to optimize a given prompt.


1. Version 1: use json as output
As an expert in optimizing prompts, your task is to refine the given prompt within the `>>Prompt<<` section. The start of content begins with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Please follow the steps below. Each step has a title, and description of the step.
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Break down the prompt and articulate your understanding of its content and intentions.

2. Summarize the Prompt:
   - Condense your analysis into a brief summary highlighting the main points and purpose of the prompt.

3. Identify the Domain of the Prompt:
   - Predict the domain of this prompt.

4. Assess and Suggest Improvements Based on the Domain of the Prompt:
   a. Articulate your opinions on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness and completeness
   b. Articulate specific areas where the prompt can be improved in terms of content and structure

5. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Present the final refined prompt, based on the assessments and suggestions from step 4. 

The output format should be in JSON, with each step title as the key, and the output of each step as the value. Here is an example format:
   {   
       "Analyze the Prompt": "Description of analysis...",
       "Summarize the Prompt": "Concise summary...",   
       "Identify the Domain of the Prompt": "Domain name...",
       "Assess and Suggest Improvements Based on the Domain of the Prompt": {
                 "a": "Opinions on clarity...",
                 "b": "Suggestions for improvement..."   
       },
       "Present the Refined Prompt": "$start$ Refined prompt content... $end$"
   }

>>Prompt<<
$start$

$end$


Version 2: Not using json output
As an expert in refining content prompts, your task is to improve the given prompt situated within the `>>Prompt<<` section, which starts with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, 4, and present the refined prompt from a new line

$start$
You are a senior software developer. Your task is to create the code design based on the requirement given in the `>Requirement<` section.

You will use the following steps to achieve the task. Each step has a title, and a description.

1. **Understand the Requirements:**
   - Articulate thoroughly your understanding of the requirements. 
    
2. **Identify Key Components:**
   - Identify the main components or entities mentioned in the requirement. Focus on high-level components or services, without delving into specific classes or functions.

3. **Identify Component Interactions:**
- Elaborate on how the identified key components interact with each other, focusing on interfaces and contracts between them.

4. ** Recall from existing knowledge **
- Draw upon your experience and knowledge of similar tasks. Consider what design approaches, interfaces, and patterns are typically employed in such scenarios.

5. **Design the Components:**
   - Create an initial code design containing file path with classes, methods, functions combining knowledge from in Step 4 and Step 3. Ensure your design adheres to SOLID principles, design patterns, and coding standards from the programming language identified. providing full implementations for existing functions and placeholder TODOs with explanations for new created interfaces. The output will be file path with its corresponding code. Use the following output format:
  ```
   file path: src/.../file1
   sample_interface1()
      TODO: here is the detailed explanation of the interface
    
   file path: src/.../file2
   sample_interface2()
      TODO: here is the detailed explanation of the interface

   more files ...
  ```

6. **Articulating the data flow**
    - Narrate thoroughly the data flow based on the code design from step 5. focusing on how data will move through the components and interact with each other to fullfil the requirement. Use real examples like the following:
    ```
    I will create a one fake object a = A(). Then create a fake object b = B(a),
    then i will call function b.multiply() 
    
    ...
    ```
$end$
