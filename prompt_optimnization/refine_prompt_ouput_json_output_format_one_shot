1. Version 1: use json as output
As an expert in optimizing prompts, your task is to refine the given prompt within the `>>Prompt<<` section. The start of content begins with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, 4, and present the refined prompt from a new line

The output format should be in JSON, with each step title as the key, and the output of each step as the value. Here is an example format:
   {   
       "Analyze the Prompt": "Description of analysis...",
       "Summarize the Prompt": "Concise summary...",   
       "Identify the Domain of the Prompt": "Domain name...",

[Prompt]
$start$
You are a Python software architect. Your task is to improve the existing Feature Code Design Documentation found in the `[Documentation]` section by referencing the Python source code given in the `[SourceCode]` section. The final documentation will follow 
the format defined in the `[Template]` section. The content of each section is enclosed 
between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.

### Background
In the past, our team wrote codes directly without adhering to the standard practice of initially designing the code architecture. We are now aiming to rectify this by incrementally creating feature code design documentation based on the existing code.

### Approach:
1. Understand the given feature design documentation.
2. Understand the Python code provided in the `[SourceCode]` section. Summarize its primary functions and its association with the existing feature.

3. Analyse each dependency functionality under package `autobyteus` from the given code. Try to analyze whether it's 'part-of' the feature or it's 'used-by' the feature. When the dependencies are under the same package as the package in the source code, then they are 'part-of' dependencies. Otherwise, they are 'used-by' dependencies.
4. Based on previous analysis steps, start to enhance the given design documentation by adding 'part-of' dependencies as new components and 'used-by' dependencies as existing components Ensure the revised documentation aligns with the format described in the `[Template]` section.

Follow the steps defined in the 'Approach'. Think step by step meticously and reason comprehensively for each step to address the task.
$end$




You are a Python software architect tasked with reverse-engineering a given code segment to deduce its feature code design.

### Background
In standard software engineering practices, the typical sequence involves feature requirement, feature code design, subtask creation, and subtask implementation. However, the code at hand was implemented without the necessary feature code design documentation. Your task is to retroactively create this documentation using the provided code.

### Criteria:
- Adhere to the format specified in the `[Template]` section for your documentation.
- Include a UML diagram following PlantUML syntax, supported by explanatory notes as showcased in `[Example]`.
- Deliver your final design documentation within a copiable code block.

### Steps:
1. Examine the source code provided in the `[SourceCode]` section.
2. Deduce the potential feature or functionality that this code segment might implement.
3. Inspect each dependency under the package `autobyteus`. Determine if it's 'part-of' the feature or 'used-by' the feature. If dependencies are from the same package as the source code, classify them as 'part-of' dependencies; otherwise, they are 'used-by' dependencies.
4. Based on your analysis, compile the design documentation. Incorporate 'part-of' dependencies from Step 3 as new components and 'used-by' dependencies as existing components.

Ensure a thorough and reasoned approach throughout each step.


Version 3:
As an expert in refining writting, your task is to improve the given writting situated within the `[Writting]` section. The content of the writting is situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.


Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's conciseness, clarity, accuracy, effectiveness, , sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure etc, usage of words etc. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why.

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, and present the refined prompt in a code block


[Writting]
$start$
As a senior Python software engineer, approach the requirements outlined between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section using a two-phase methodology:

Phase 1: Analytical Breakdown
- Dissect the provided requirements to understand their essence.
- Think methodically and reason comprehensively, providing a step-by-step breakdown of your approach.
- Explain any design decisions, considerations, or architectural changes made.

Phase 2: Summarized Implementation
- After the analytical breakdown, provide a concise summary of the updated source code.
- Follow Python PEP8 coding best practices, SOLID principles, and employ appropriate design patterns.
- Use type hints in your code. Ensure each file has a file-level docstring and update these docstrings in line with any code modifications.
- For file management, specify whether to create a new folder or use an existing one. Ensure names for files and folders correlate with the requirement's features.
  For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        workspaces
            workspace_service.py
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute imports over relative ones.
- Present the code modifications using the following format:
{
   command: action_type (e.g., update_file),
   file_path: path_to_file,
   content: modified_content
}

    Here are available commands with their metadata definition:
    update_file: used to update the content of file
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        content: the content to be written to the file.

    update_function: used to update a specific function
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        function name: the function to be updated.
        content: the new function content.

By following this two-phase methodology, the output should be a blend of comprehensive reasoning followed by a succinct summary of the actual code changes.

  put the test file for the source file.
    src
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
- Use command write_file(file_path, content) to write the complete updated code to file   path. 

Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the task. 

$end$


[Requirement]
$start$
The prompt is sent to the LLM. I want the LLM to perform a step-by-step thinking process, emulating a human approach. At the end, I want the LLM to include the text "write_file" in its output. My parser will search for the "write_file" keyword in the LLM's result.

By making this revision, it's clear that you are looking for the LLM to generate the text "write_file" within its response, rather than executing the function. This should eliminate any potential misunderstanding or ambiguity in the requirement.

Can you please improve the prompt please?
