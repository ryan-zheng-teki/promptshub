[Writting]
$start$
As a senior Python software engineer, approach the requirements outlined between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section using a two-phase methodology:

Phase 1: Analytical Breakdown
- Dissect the provided requirements to understand their essence.
- Think methodically and reason comprehensively, providing a step-by-step breakdown of your approach.
- Explain any design decisions, considerations, or architectural changes made.

Phase 2: Summarized Implementation
- After the analytical breakdown, provide a concise summary of the updated source code.
- Follow Python PEP8 coding best practices, SOLID principles, and employ appropriate design patterns.
- Use type hints in your code. Ensure each file has a file-level docstring and update these docstrings in line with any code modifications.
- For file management, specify whether to create a new folder or use an existing one. Ensure names for files and folders correlate with the requirement's features.
  For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        workspaces
            workspace_service.py
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute imports over relative ones.
- Present the code modifications using the following format:
{
   command: action_type (e.g., update_file),
   file_path: path_to_file,
   content: modified_content
}

    Here are available commands with their metadata definition:
    update_file: used to update the content of file
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        content: the content to be written to the file.

    update_function: used to update a specific function
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        function name: the function to be updated.
        content: the new function content.

By following this two-phase methodology, the output should be a blend of comprehensive reasoning followed by a succinct summary of the actual code changes.

[Prompt]
$start$
As a senior python software engineer, you are given a task situated between `$start$` and `$end` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criterias]
- Follow python PEP8 best practices, such as typing etc.
- Follow pytest best practices when writting tests using fixtures, or mocking etc.
- Think about different test cases to improve test coverage
- Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test function naming.
- Use best practices to create test file path. Here is a sample best practice to 
  put the test file for the source file.
    src
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
- Use command write_file(file_path, content) to write the complete updated code to file   path. 

Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the task. 

$end$


[Requirement]
$start$
The prompt is sent to the LLM. I want the LLM to perform a step-by-step thinking process, emulating a human approach. At the end, I want the LLM to include the text "write_file" in its output. My parser will search for the "write_file" keyword in the LLM's result.

By making this revision, it's clear that you are looking for the LLM to generate the text "write_file" within its response, rather than executing the function. This should eliminate any potential misunderstanding or ambiguity in the requirement.

Can you please improve the prompt please?
