Prompt Description: This prompt is used to optimize a given prompt.


1. Version 1: use json as output
As an expert in optimizing prompts, your task is to refine the given prompt within the `>>Prompt<<` section. The start of content begins with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, 4, and present the refined prompt from a new line

The output format should be in JSON, with each step title as the key, and the output of each step as the value. Here is an example format:
   {   
       "Analyze the Prompt": "Description of analysis...",
       "Summarize the Prompt": "Concise summary...",   
       "Identify the Domain of the Prompt": "Domain name...",
       "Assess and Suggest Improvements Based on the Domain of the Prompt": {
                 "a": "Opinions on clarity...",
                 "b": "Suggestions for improvement..."   
       },
       "Present the Refined Prompt": "$start$ Refined prompt content... $end$"
   }

>>Prompt<<
$start$
$end$


Version 2: Not using json output
As an expert in refining content prompts, your task is to improve the given prompt situated within the `[Prompt]` section. The content of the prompt is situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.

[Context]
The majority of the prompt is already quite good, it's very small minor areas which could be improved.


Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your opinions on the prompt's clarity, accuracy, effectiveness, conciseness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure etc, usage of words etc. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why. One criteria is to use commonly used words instead of less frequently used words.

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - The prompt should always start with "You are ...".
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, and present the refined prompt in a copiable code block.

As an Python architect with strong prompt refining skills, you are tasked with refining the content of the prompt found between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Prompt]` section.

[Context]
Most of the prompt is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.

Follow these steps:
1. **Analyze the Prompt**:
   - Break down the prompt to understand its intent and main points.

2. **Determine the Domain**:
   - Identify the subject or category of this prompt.

3. **Recommend Improvements**:
   - Share your thoughts on its clarity, accuracy, consistency, sentence structure, and word choice. Suggest improvements where needed, prioritizing common words over less frequently used ones.

4. **Provide the Improved Prompt**:
   - Begin your refined prompt with "You are ...". Use simple English. Then, share the improved version in a copiable code block.


$start$
You are a Python software architect. Your task is to progressively reverse-engineer code files to assemble design documentation for an entire feature. Files will be provided one at a time due to your limited context size. You will continually evolve the code design documentation with each additional file.

### Criteria:
- Ensure the design documentation is consistent with the `[Template]` section, Continue adapt the documentation with each additional file.
- Present the design documentation in a copiable code block.

### Procedure:
1. **Review the Source Code**:
    - Thoroughly examine the provided code file in the [SourceCode] section. As you review, make preliminary notes on key functionalities and structures.

2. **Identify File's Role and Dependencies**:
    - Determine the primary function or role of the file within the larger feature's context.
    - Identify and classify each project package dependency within the file:
      - If it's directly related to the feature and its code is not provided, label it as 'part-of'.
      - If it's an auxiliary or external tool/service supporting the feature, label it as 'used-by'.

3. **Draft and Update the Documentation**:
    - Based on insights from the file and its dependencies, draft the corresponding section of the design documentation. mark part-of dependencies as also new components. Leave the component specification as empty for now. Later when additional code file for that component is provided, then fill the missing component specification.

Follow the steps defined in 'Procedure' section, think meticously and reason comprehensively for each step.

[Prompt]
$start$
As a senior python software engineer, you are given a task situated between `$start$` and `$end` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criterias]
- Follow python PEP8 best practices, such as typing etc.
- Follow pytest best practices when writting tests using fixtures, or mocking etc.
- Think about different test cases to improve test coverage
- Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test function naming.
- Use best practices to create test file path. Here is a sample best practice to 
  put the test file for the source file.
    src
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
- Use command write_file(file_path, content) to write the complete updated code to file   path. 

Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the task. 

$end$


[Requirement]
$start$
The prompt is sent to the LLM. I want the LLM to perform a step-by-step thinking process, emulating a human approach. At the end, I want the LLM to include the text "write_file" in its output. My parser will search for the "write_file" keyword in the LLM's result.

By making this revision, it's clear that you are looking for the LLM to generate the text "write_file" within its response, rather than executing the function. This should eliminate any potential misunderstanding or ambiguity in the requirement.

Can you please improve the prompt please?

You are tasked with updating the code design documentation and then formulating subtasks based on the design. Prioritize new and updated components. Use the provided template for each subtask.

### Steps: 
1. **Identify Subtasks**:
    - Pinpoint necessary subtasks, focusing on new and updated components. Sequence them according to their interdependencies.
  
2. **Preliminary Setup**:
    - Will new libraries be required? 
    - Are there new folders or files? If so, adopt consistent naming conventions. Reason about the optimal location using the existing project folder structure.
  
3. **Formulate Each Subtask**:
    - Begin with Task 1: Setup of required libraries and directories. Example:
    ```
    Task 1: Preliminary Setup
    #task start#
    Purpose: Set up libraries and directory structure.
    File Specification: requirements.txt, autobyteus/repositories, autobyteus/utils
    Details: Add SQLAlchemy and Alembic to requirements.txt. Establish necessary folders and files.
    Integration Points: None.
    #task end#
    ```
    - Structure subsequent subtasks in order of dependency, each concentrating on a specific component or class.

### Current Project Folder Structure
    autobyteus
        db
    tests
        unit_tests
        integration_tests
    requirements.txt
