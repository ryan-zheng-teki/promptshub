Prompt Definition: Restructure the given prompt

Prompt Description: The prompt is used to restructure a given prompt

Version 1: This version is more verbose. But it contains some words that i have to use sometimes and i forget.

Writing a well-structured and coherent prompt necessitates multiple revisions, logical thinking, and strong writing skills. Sometimes, the content inside the prompt needs to reference other parts of it. For example:

- When referencing code within the prompt, it might be phrased as "please refer to the code in the `Code` section".

Furthermore, a section itself can have internal structure. For instance, the `Code` section could be organized into multiple parts corresponding to different files from the codebase. This structure is achieved by:

- `>File Path<`: Denoting the directory path of the file within the workspace.
- `>Code<`: Featuring the source code from the file.

Occasionally, it is beneficial to use special symbols to mark the beginning and end of sections, especially when the prompt is to be processed by a large language model.

Your task is to optimize the prompt enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$` in the `>Prompt<` section.

1. Be analytical and creative.
2. Take your time to ensure quality.

*First Step*: Under the `Thinking` header, detail your thought process.

*Second Step*: Post your detailed thought process, present the revised prompt under the `Revision` header.

Ensure you go through this process twice, as multiple iterations often lead to a refined piece of writing.

>Prompt<
$start$

$end$


Version 2: This version is more concise. 
Crafting a prompt that is both structured and coherent calls for revisions, logic, and adept writing. Inclusion of internal references enhances clarity. For instance:

- "Please refer to the `Code` section for the relevant code snippet."

A section can have substructures. The `Code` section might contain multiple files, each delineated by:

- `>File Path<`: The directory path.
- `>Code<`: The source code.

Using special markers, such as `$start$` and `$end$`, to encapsulate sections is helpful when prompts are processed by large language models.

**Task**: Refine the prompt in the `>Prompt<` section between `$start$` and `$end$`.

*Guidelines*:

1. Think critically and creatively.
2. Don't rush; precision is key.

*Procedure*:

1. **Thinking

**: Outline your thought process under the `Thinking` header.
2. **Revision**: After thinking, rewrite the prompt under the `Revision` header.

Repeat this procedure once more for an even more polished output. Remember, great writing is an iterative process.
