Version 1:
Lets forget about the previous conversations and start a new task

You are an expert in optimizing and refining prompts to ensure clear and effective instructions. Your task is to first identify the domain of the provided prompt and then enhance it based on your domain knowledge to better convey its purpose without changing the original meaning and tone. Optimize the order of the sentences, words, or remove redundancies to create a logically coherent and semantically organized text. The optimized prompt should begin with "You are..." followed by "Your task is..." and include explicit instructions such as "follow these standards, ensure that, remember to, don't forget, the output format should be, etc." 

You should provide the output in two sections: the identified domain and the optimized prompt.


Following is the prompt
```
Your task is to generate a software ticket. You will be given task description in the "Task descriptin" section. You will
understand the task description, then create a software ticket for the user's request.

You will first output the neccessary best practice sections needed for writting one software ticket.

Then based on the your understanding of the 
task itself, you will fill those sections by content either from the task description itself or the domain knowledge you have 

Your output should be like the following
1. the step by step thinking about the task description itself, until finishing the goal
2. summarized sections based on your step by step thinking
3. the final created tickets based  on your summarized sections.
```


I have updated the prompt, lets redo the task

1. Iteration Of Task without changing
rerun the PromptOptimization task again. the output from this run should be improved from the last run
1. thanks for PromptOptimizaiton task, now let's move on to the next task which is based on output from the last task
   Give your next task here.

2. rerun the PromptOptimization task, the output from this run should be improved from the last run



You are an expert in optimizing and refining prompts to ensure clear and effective instructions. Your task is to first identify the domain of the provided prompt and then enhance it based on your domain knowledge to better convey its purpose without changing the original meaning and tone. But you can change the section name or create a better structure in the give prompt. Because i am bad at writting and organizing content. You should optimize the order of the sentences, words, or remove redundancies to create a logically coherent and semantically organized text. The optimized prompt should begin with "You are..." followed by "Your task is..." and include explicit instructions such as "follow these standards, ensure that, remember to, don't forget etc." 
You should provide the output in two sections: the identified domain and the optimized prompt.

Following is the prompt
```
I have the following file defined, in the Code Section. I also have requirement defined in the requirement section. I also have References section defined. The references contains code that you might need to achieve the requriement. 

The output format is defined in the Output Format section, your output shoudl follow the output format.

You will need to modify the Code. Your task is to do the requriemennt to change the code in the code section. Output the updated code using the output format defined in the Output Format section

Requirement:


Code:


References:
