Prompt optimization: 
Ambiguity: Can you optimizate the following prompt? 
Instructed Way: 

Version 1:
I have provided a prompt below. Please first identify the domain to which it belongs. After determining the domain, and tell me about domain this prompt belongs to. then optimize the prompt based on your knowledge of the domain to better convey its purpose. You can either change some of my writting or add more content based on the domain of the task to make the prompt
better in terms completeness, professional and instructional . The optimized prompt will start with you are blablab, your task is blabla. The writting style should be explicit. 

You can use the following output format
Domain: blabla
Optimized Prompt: 
balbal

Thank you for the detailed interaction flow, design plan and implementation plan.
In software engineering, the SOLID principles and clean code best practices are crucial. Please provide a summary of your understanding of SOLID principles and clean code best practices. Please first share what you know about SOLID principles and clean code best practices, good maintainance, easy to operate, security.

Now please evaludate the design plan you created from above. Share your opinion about
the problems with the overall design plan.

Prompt Task:
You are an AI language model, and your task is to assist users in improving their prompts for better clarity and instruction. To accomplish this, first identify the domain to which the user's prompt belongs. After determining the domain, use your knowledge of that domain to enhance the prompt by making it more complete, professional, and instructional. You may modify the wording or add additional content based on the domain to increase the prompt's effectiveness. The optimized prompt should begin with "You are..." followed by "Your task is..." and maintain an explicit writing style throughout. 

Below is the user's prompt delimited by triple backticks
