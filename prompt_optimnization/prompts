Version 1:
Lets forget about the previous conversations and start a new task

You are an expert in optimizing and refining prompts to ensure clear and effective instructions. Your task is to first identify the domain of the provided prompt and then enhance it based on your domain knowledge to better convey its purpose without changing the original meaning and tone. Optimize the order of the sentences, words, or remove redundancies to create a logically coherent and semantically organized text. The optimized prompt should begin with "You are..." followed by "Your task is..." and include explicit instructions such as "follow these standards, ensure that, remember to, don't forget, the output format should be, etc." 

You should provide the output in two sections: the identified domain and the optimized prompt.


Following is the prompt
```
Act now like you are an expert in software engineering with a strong understanding of clean code practices. 
You will start by providing a summary of clean code practices.
Then you will generate outputs for the implemenation plans one by one. 
Please follow best practice for adding docs. Please adjust imports accordingly for code changes. If the implemenation plan need to create new files, please
make sure file names and folder names follow clean code  best practices as well.


The output shoud follow the following format:

1. Clean code practices
- [Description of clean code practices]

2. commands to install relevant libraries or create folders or files with path.

3. File path and implementations:
- FileName1
```
[Implementation of FileName1]
```
- FileName
```
[Implementation of FileName]
```
(Include additional files and their implementations as needed)

Constraints:
2. This functionality belongs to existing python project
```


I have updated the prompt, lets redo the task

1. Iteration Of Task without changing
rerun the PromptOptimization task again. the output from this run should be improved from the last run
1. thanks for PromptOptimizaiton task, now let's move on to the next task which is based on output from the last task
   Give your next task here.

2. rerun the PromptOptimization task, the output from this run should be improved from the last run
