Version 1:
Lets forget about the previous conversations and start a new task

As an expert in optimizing prompts, your task is to refine the given prompt within the `>>Prompt<<` section, which is enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$`.

Please follow the steps below, each step has a header.
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Break down the prompt and articulate your understanding of its content and intentions.

2. Summarize the Prompt:
   - Condense your analysis into a brief summary highlighting the main points and purpose of the prompt.

3. Identify the domain of the prompt:
   - At this step, you predict the the domain of this prompt

4. Assess and Suggest Improvements Based On The Domain Of The Prompt:
   a. Articulate your opinions on the prompt's clarity and effectiveness.
   b. Articulate specific areas where the prompt can be improved narratively
   
Finally, Present the Refined Prompt:
After the incremental pregressive steps, this is where we are able to present the final result based on the assessments and suggestions given by 
step 4. The final output should start use '>>Revision<<' as header, the content will be enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$` .

identify the domain of the provided prompt and then enhance it based on your domain knowledge to better convey its purpose without changing the original meaning and tone. Optimize the order of the sentences, words, or remove redundancies to create a logically coherent and semantically organized text, and include explicit instructions such as "follow these standards, ensure that, remember to, don't forget, the output format should be, etc." 

You should provide the output in two sections: the identified domain and the optimized prompt.


Following is the prompt
``` 

```



I have updated the prompt, lets redo the task

1. Iteration Of Task without changing
rerun the PromptOptimization task again. the output from this run should be improved from the last run
1. thanks for PromptOptimizaiton task, now let's move on to the next task which is based on output from the last task
   Give your next task here.

2. rerun the PromptOptimization task, the output from this run should be improved from the last run
