[Writing]
$start$
As a senior software architect, your task is to identify all the requirement specifications from `ModuleA` which are functionally relevant to `ModuleB`.

**Context**
In software engineering, module development is driven by requirements categorization or architectural enhancement. The introduction of a new module, `ModuleB`, may necessitate updates to an existing module, `ModuleA`, due to shared responsibilities, responsiblity shifting or integration needs. The requirement documentations for both modules provided in the `[ModuleA]` and `[ModuleB]` sections are written adhering to the requirement specification format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section, with requirement specifications listed under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements." headings. Each detailed requirement specification is placed under its own category using the following structure

```
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>
   - ...
```

To identiy the relevant requirement items from `ModuleA`, typically, human will analyze each requirement specification item  from `ModuleA` and compare it to the `Module Description` of `ModuleB`, do a reasoning whether the item is functionally relevant to the `ModuleB`.

In this task, you need to perform the same thinking process like human. Your thinking output for this analytical process should adhere to the following given format:

```
I will review each specification item under each category within the "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" sections sequentially from `ModuleA`.

Now, I will assess the specifications in all categories under "4.1 Functional Requirements" for ModuleA:

The first category is ..., 
  The first specification is ..., and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ...,  Because ..., Hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.
  the second specification is ..., and the Module Description from ModuleB is ..., 
  Because ..., Hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.

The second category is ...,
  the first specification is ..., and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ..., 
   Because ..., Hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.

This reasoning continues until all specifications items under all categories of "4.1 Functional Requirements" are covered.

Now, I will proceed with each specification in all categories under "4.2 Technical Requirements":

The first category is ..., 
  The first specification is ...,and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ..., 
  Because ..., Hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.
  The second specification is ..., and the `Module Description` from ModuleB is ..., 
  Because ..., Hence, the specification is/is not relevant to ModuleB.
...
```

Now please take a deep breath, think step by step to perform the task.
$end$

[UserRequest]
The whole writting is really good. could you please do minial refinements. Please do not change the wording. I notice that you normally replace the straightforward words with less frequent words.

Specification Item: Each step in the workflow can potentially have sub-steps.

Initiating Step: AnalyzeAndDecideRelevance within the global EXECUTION PLAN. Each action will be executed in sequence. I will always be mindful of this context.

Executing Action: Print the "Module Description" section of moduleB_RequirementSpecification

ModuleB Description:
The Prompt Versioning Mechanism Module serves as a centralized manager for prompt versioning across all entities in the system. By abstracting common functionalities, this module enables each entity to be able to have different versions of prompts.

Executing Action: REASON whether specificationItem could be functionally related to moduleDescriptionOfModuleB




**Introduction to the Prompting Procedure Programming**:
The Prompting Procedure Programming, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Procedure Programming?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Procedure Programming aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:
1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
- **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
- **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
- **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
- **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
- **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
- **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
- **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
- **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
- **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
- **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
- **Example**:
```
content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
```

6. **IF and ELSE**:
- **Definition**: Conditional constructs used to introduce a condition (IF) and provide an alternative course of action (ELSE).
- **Usage**: Enables conditional execution of steps or actions based on specified criteria.

7. **LABEL**:
- **Definition**: Marks a specific line or point in the procedure.
- **Usage**: Acts as a reference point for JUMP directives.

8. **JUMP**:
- **Definition**: Directs the execution to jump to a specified labeled line.
- **Usage**: Used in conjunction with LABEL to control the flow of execution.

9. **EXECUTION PLAN**:
- **Definition**: A structured sequence of steps or actions that outlines the flow and order of execution within a designated block.
- **Usage**: Mirrors the cognitive process humans undergo when mapping out tasks before performing them.

10. **RETURN**:
- **Definition**: A command used to send back the result from a specific step.
- **Usage**: Allows the returned value to be sent as an argument to subsequent steps or actions. 
- **Example**:
```
Step AnalyzeThePrompt(promptContent):
    content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
    RETURN content, objectives
```

**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Procedure Programming encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.




As a senior software architect, your task is to identify all the requirement specifications from `ModuleA` that are functionally relevant to `ModuleB`.

**Context**
In software engineering, module development is informed by requirements categorization and architectural enhancement. The introduction of `ModuleB` may require updates to `ModuleA` due to overlapping responsibilities, responsibility shifts, or integration needs. The requirement documentation for both modules is provided in the `[ModuleA]` and `[ModuleB]` sections and is formatted according to the `[Template]` section, with requirements under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements."

To identify the relevant items from `ModuleA`, analyze each requirement under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" and compare them to the `Module Description` of `ModuleB`. Assess whether each item has functional relevance to `ModuleB`.

Your analytical output should follow this structure:

I will sequentially review the specification items under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" from `ModuleA`.

Assessing "4.1 Functional Requirements":

The first category is ..., 
  with specifications ..., 

The second category includes ...,

Continue this reasoning for all specifications under "4.1 Functional Requirements."

Next, evaluate "4.2 Technical Requirements":

The first category features ..., 
  including specifications ...,

...

Approach this task methodically, step by step.
