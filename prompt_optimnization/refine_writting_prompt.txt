Follow the steps below:
1. **Analyze the Writing**:
   - Examine the writing to grasp its content and goals.
   - Identify the domain of the writing.

2. **Analyze the User Request**:
   - Understand the specific concerns of the user based on the writing.

3. **Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities**:
   - **Identify Potential Questions or Ambiguities**: 
     * Based on the provided information, list out potential areas of uncertainty.
   - **Self-Reasoning for Identified Ambiguities**:
     * Attempt to resolve as many ambiguities as possible internally.
   - **Are there genuine ambiguities left?**
     * **No**: 
       + Proceed to Step 4.

4. **Plan Improvements**:
   - Plan the necessary improvements considering the criteria mentioned in the `[Criteria]` section.

5. **Present the complete refined writing in a copiable text block**:


[Writing]
$start$
You are a "Prompt Evaluator." Your task is to identify where and why the original prompt leads to unsatisfactory results outputted by ChatGPT. After pinpointing the issues, you will plan improvement to enhance its clarity and explicitness, ensuring more desirable results.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the objectives and intent of the original prompt in the [OriginalPrompt] section.
2. Analyze the user feedback in the [Feedback] section against the output in the  `[Output]` section, focusing on areas of dissatisfaction.
3. Analyze where and why the original prompt leads to the dissatisfaction
4. Based on previous analysis, plan changes to improve clarity and explicitness.


Follow the steps outlined in the `Procedure`, ensuring meticulous, step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.

[OriginalPrompt]
$start$

$end$

[Output]



[Feedback]
$end$

[UserRequest]
Please fix grammar mistake. If there are sentences after your analysis, you think its not explicit enough, improve the clarify.





[ChatGPT_Output]
Executing Action: PRINT value of variable category and specificationItem

Category: Workflow Management
Specification Item: Each step in the workflow can potentially have sub-steps.

Initiating Step: AnalyzeAndDecideRelevance within the global EXECUTION PLAN. Each action will be executed in sequence. I will always be mindful of this context.

Executing Action: Print the "Module Description" section of moduleB_RequirementSpecification

ModuleB Description:
The Prompt Versioning Mechanism Module serves as a centralized manager for prompt versioning across all entities in the system. By abstracting common functionalities, this module enables each entity to be able to have different versions of prompts.

Executing Action: REASON whether specificationItem could be functionally related to moduleDescriptionOfModuleB




**Introduction to the Prompting Procedure Programming**:
The Prompting Procedure Programming, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Procedure Programming?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Procedure Programming aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:
1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
- **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
- **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
- **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
- **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
- **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
- **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
- **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
- **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
- **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
- **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
- **Example**:
```
content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
```

6. **IF and ELSE**:
- **Definition**: Conditional constructs used to introduce a condition (IF) and provide an alternative course of action (ELSE).
- **Usage**: Enables conditional execution of steps or actions based on specified criteria.

7. **LABEL**:
- **Definition**: Marks a specific line or point in the procedure.
- **Usage**: Acts as a reference point for JUMP directives.

8. **JUMP**:
- **Definition**: Directs the execution to jump to a specified labeled line.
- **Usage**: Used in conjunction with LABEL to control the flow of execution.

9. **EXECUTION PLAN**:
- **Definition**: A structured sequence of steps or actions that outlines the flow and order of execution within a designated block.
- **Usage**: Mirrors the cognitive process humans undergo when mapping out tasks before performing them.

10. **RETURN**:
- **Definition**: A command used to send back the result from a specific step.
- **Usage**: Allows the returned value to be sent as an argument to subsequent steps or actions. 
- **Example**:
```
Step AnalyzeThePrompt(promptContent):
    content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
    RETURN content, objectives
```

**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Procedure Programming encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.
