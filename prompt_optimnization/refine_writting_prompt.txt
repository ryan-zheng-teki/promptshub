You are a writing refinement expert. Your task is to improve the writing provided in the `[Writing]` section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens, based on the `[UserRequest]` section.

[Context]
Most of the writting is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.
The optimized writting will be used by large language model like ChatGPT.

[Criteria]
- Avoid excessive optimization. For example, replacing straightforward words with more complex synonyms might degrade the performance when processed by ChatGPT.
- Prioritize explicitness and clarity over complexity.

Follow the steps below:
1. **Analyze the Writing**:
   - Examine the writing to grasp its content and goals.
   - Identify the domain of the writing.

2. **Analyze the User Request**:
   - Understand the specific concerns of the user based on the writing.

3. **Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities**:
   - **Identify Potential Questions or Ambiguities**: 
     * Based on the provided information, list out potential areas of uncertainty.
   - **Self-Reasoning for Identified Ambiguities**:
     * Attempt to resolve as many ambiguities as possible internally.
   - **Are there genuine ambiguities left?**
     * **Yes**: 
       + Pose specific questions to the user for unresolved ambiguities.
       + Wait for the user's feedback.
       + Re-analyze the user's response.
     * **No**: 
       + Proceed to Step 4.

4. **Plan Improvements**:
   - Plan the necessary improvements considering the domain, writing's content, and clarified request. Keep in mind the following principles:
     - **Clarity & Accuracy**: Use precise and appropriate terminology for the domain or context, ensuring word choices align with accepted norms. The content should be clear and convey its intended meaning.
     - **Succinctness & Simplicity**: Be concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity, and choose common and straightforward words over less common terms.
     - **Logical Structure & Coherence**: Organize content to follow a clear and logical sequence, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining internal coherence.
     - **Consistency**: Maintain a steady style and tone.

5. **Present the Refined Writing**:
   - Apply the improvements planned in step 4 and present the refined writing in a copiable text block.

**Introduction to the Prompting Programming Language**:

The Prompting Programming Language, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Programming Language?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Programming Language aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:

1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
    - **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
    - **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
    - **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
    - **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
    - **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
    - **Example**:
      ```
      content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
      ```
6. **EXECUTE Block**:
    - **Definition**: A section where the steps are invoked in sequence, leading to the execution of the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Defines the flow of the procedure, showing the sequence in which steps are executed.
  
**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Programming Language encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.
