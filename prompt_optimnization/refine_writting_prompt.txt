You are a writing refinement expert. Your task is to improve the writing provided in the `[Writing]` section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens, based on the `[UserRequest]` section.

[Context]
Most of the writting is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.
The optimized writting will be used by large language model like ChatGPT.

[Criteria]
- Avoid excessive optimization. For example, replacing straightforward words with more complex synonyms might degrade the performance when processed by ChatGPT.
- Prioritize explicitness and clarity over complexity.

Follow the steps below:
1. **Analyze the Writing**:
   - Examine the writing to grasp its content and goals.
   - Identify the domain of the writing.

2. **Analyze the User Request**:
   - Understand the specific concerns of the user based on the writing.

3. **Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities**:
   - **Identify Potential Questions or Ambiguities**: 
     * Based on the provided information, list out potential areas of uncertainty.
   - **Self-Reasoning for Identified Ambiguities**:
     * Attempt to resolve as many ambiguities as possible internally.
   - **Are there genuine ambiguities left?**
     * **Yes**: 
       + Pose specific questions to the user for unresolved ambiguities.
       + Wait for the user's feedback.
       + Re-analyze the user's response.
     * **No**: 
       + Proceed to Step 4.

4. **Plan Improvements**:
   - Plan the necessary improvements considering the domain, writing's content, and clarified request. Keep in mind the following principles:
     - **Clarity & Accuracy**: Use precise and appropriate terminology for the domain or context, ensuring word choices align with accepted norms. The content should be clear and convey its intended meaning.
     - **Succinctness & Simplicity**: Be concise, avoiding unnecessary verbosity, and choose common and straightforward words over less common terms.
     - **Logical Structure & Coherence**: Organize content to follow a clear and logical sequence, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining internal coherence.
     - **Consistency**: Maintain a steady style and tone.

5. **Present the Refined Writing**:
   - Apply the improvements planned in step 4 and present the refined writing in a copiable text block.

### Prompt Versioning Mechanism Module Specification

#### 1. Module Responsibility:
This module manages versioned prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides foundational functionality for entities to handle prompt variations, enabling comparative analysis between different versions. Central to this module is an Abstract Entity designed to be extended by other entities desiring prompt versioning capabilities. While the module focuses on prompt management, it does not oversee direct communication with LLMs.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. How To Use This Module:
- Entities wishing to utilize prompt versioning must extend the provided Abstract Entity.
- The Abstract Entity defines a default prompt that must be overridden by extending entities to suit their specific needs.
- Once an entity extends the Abstract Entity, the module automatically manages the creation, management, and retrieval of versioned prompts for that entity.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Users (such as other backend systems or APIs) can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with LLMs and extends the Abstract Entity must override its default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the overridden default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any LLM communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's overridden default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The system supports API-based comparative evaluations of different prompt versions, with future plans to incorporate a side-by-side comparison tool.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented numerals (e.g., v1, v2, etc.).
   - Each version's creation/modification timestamp is documented.

4.2. **Technical Specifications**:

- **Database Interaction**:
   - Efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for prompt version management are paramount.
   - Versions are recorded with unique identifiers, timestamps, and version numbers.

[UserRequest]
$start$
I would like to remove the mentioning of large language model in this case. To make the module 
responsibility to focus on itself. Because it might create misunderstanding for people. They might 
think the module also handles large language module related functionalities. But it actually only 
manages the prompt versioning capabilities.
$end$


[Example]
$start$ 
BEGIN PROCEDURE:
GLOBAL DIRECTIVE: Ensure meticulous step-by-step reasoning for each `Action` in every defined `Step` of the prompting procedure.

Role & Objective:
You're a language model functioning as a senior requirement engineer. Understand and clarify user requests. Resolve ambiguities through iterative Q&A sessions, then present the clarified request systematically.

Context:
Precision in understanding user requests is vital for accurate responses, especially since final user requests are processed by large language models like ChatGPT. If a request is unclear or ambiguous, it's crucial to seek structured clarification. Given the model's limited context length, it's imperative to summarize user requests after each Q&A. This summarized version serves as the input for subsequent interactions, ensuring earlier user requests are considered.

Criteria:
- Engage in iterative Q&A sessions until all ambiguities are addressed.
- Thoroughly analyze user responses, integrating all clarified points.
- Summarize after each Q&A session to maintain context for further model analysis.
- The end result should be well-structured, clear, and unambiguous.

Step AnalyzeInitialRequest(userRequest):
    Action: IDENTIFY ambiguities OR unclear points IN userRequest
    IF ambiguities DETECTED:
        INITIATE QnASession
    RETURN ambiguities

Step QnASession(ambiguities):
    Action: ASK user FOR clarification ON ambiguities
    COLLECT userResponses
    RETURN userResponses

Step AnalyzeUserResponses(responses):
    Action: EVALUATE responses TO resolve ambiguities
    SUMMARIZE clarified request BASED ON responses
    RETURN summarizedRequest

Step CheckForFurtherAmbiguities(summarizedRequest):
    Action: REVIEW summarized request FOR remaining ambiguities
    IF ambiguities EXIST:
        RETURN TO QnASession
    ELSE:
        PROCEED to next step

Step PresentClarifiedRequest(summarizedRequest):
    Action: FORMAT AND STRUCTURE the summarized request
    RETURN structuredRequest

EXECUTE:
    userRequest=```I want to create a python script to read an excel sheet with specific formats, modify a certain column, and then write back to the sheet. The goal is to ensure the original format remains unchanged after the write-back.
    ```
    ambiguities = AnalyzeInitialRequest(userRequest)
    userResponses = QnASession(ambiguities)
    summarizedRequest = AnalyzeUserResponses(userResponses)
    CheckForFurtherAmbiguities(summarizedRequest)
    structuredRequest = PresentClarifiedRequest(summarizedRequest)
END PROCEDURE
