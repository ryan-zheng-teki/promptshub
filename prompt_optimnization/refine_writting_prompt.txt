[UserRequest]
I think we could add a Context section in the Template and Example.  Context section could add some background information for the prompt. Since LLM works in a way 
by collaborative attentioning, so adding a context section with some helper or background information could help LLM to understand better of the 
prompt to be created or domain or steps for the procedure.
