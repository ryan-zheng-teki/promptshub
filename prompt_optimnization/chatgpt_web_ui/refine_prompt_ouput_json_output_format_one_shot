Prompt Description: This prompt is used to optimize a given prompt.


1. Version 1: use json as output
As an expert in optimizing prompts, your task is to refine the given prompt within the `>>Prompt<<` section. The start of content begins with `$start$` and ends with `$end$`.

Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Articulate your thoughts on the prompt's clarity, effectiveness, sentence structure, consistency, coherence, and word order, content structure. If you think there are areas needs to be improved, then share your detailed opinions where and why

4. Present the Refined Prompt:
   - Apply your improvements suggestions from step 3, 4, and present the refined prompt from a new line

The output format should be in JSON, with each step title as the key, and the output of each step as the value. Here is an example format:
   {   
       "Analyze the Prompt": "Description of analysis...",
       "Summarize the Prompt": "Concise summary...",   
       "Identify the Domain of the Prompt": "Domain name...",
       "Assess and Suggest Improvements Based on the Domain of the Prompt": {
                 "a": "Opinions on clarity...",
                 "b": "Suggestions for improvement..."   
       },
       "Present the Refined Prompt": "$start$ Refined prompt content... $end$"
   }

>>Prompt<<
$start$
$end$


Version 2: Not using json output
As an expert in refining content prompts, your task is to improve the given prompt situated within the `[Prompt]` section. The content of the prompt is situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens. Your target audience for this task consists of large language models like GPT-3.


Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Step By Step Evaluate and Recommend Linguistic Enhancements:
   - Provide your insights on the prompt's content structure, section structure, sentence structure, clarity, accuracy, effectiveness, conciseness, consistency, coherence,word usage, etc. The goal is to create 
   highly clear and structured prompt with minimum ambiguity.
   - If you identify areas that require improvement, elaborate on these aspects and explain your reasoning.

[Writting]
$start$
As a senior Python software engineer, approach the requirements outlined between the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section using a two-phase methodology:

Phase 1: Analytical Breakdown
- Dissect the provided requirements to understand their essence.
- Think methodically and reason comprehensively, providing a step-by-step breakdown of your approach.
- Explain any design decisions, considerations, or architectural changes made.

Phase 2: Summarized Implementation
- After the analytical breakdown, provide a concise summary of the updated source code.
- Follow Python PEP8 coding best practices, SOLID principles, and employ appropriate design patterns.
- Use type hints in your code. Ensure each file has a file-level docstring and update these docstrings in line with any code modifications.
- For file management, specify whether to create a new folder or use an existing one. Ensure names for files and folders correlate with the requirement's features.
  For reference, here is a sample of the current project file structure:
    src
        ...
        workspaces
            workspace_service.py
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            ...
            semantic_code
                index
                    test_index_service_integration.py
- Always use absolute imports over relative ones.
- Present the code modifications using the following format:
{
   command: action_type (e.g., update_file),
   file_path: path_to_file,
   content: modified_content
}

    Here are available commands with their metadata definition:
    update_file: used to update the content of file
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        content: the content to be written to the file.

    update_function: used to update a specific function
    arguments:
        file_path: the file to be updated.
        function name: the function to be updated.
        content: the new function content.

By following this two-phase methodology, the output should be a blend of comprehensive reasoning followed by a succinct summary of the actual code changes.

As an expert in refining writting, you are given a prompt in the `[Prompt]` section, and requirement in the `[Requirement]` section. The content of both section are situated within the `$start$` and `$end$` tokens. Your task is to analyse the prompt according to the requirement.


Follow the steps below, each accompanied by a title and a description:
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which this prompt belongs.

3. Analyse the prompt according to the requirement.

[Prompt]
$start$
As a senior python software engineer, you are given a task situated between `$start$` and `$end` tokens in the `[Requirement]` section.

[Criterias]
- Follow python PEP8 best practices, such as typing etc.
- Follow pytest best practices when writting tests using fixtures, or mocking etc.
- Think about different test cases to improve test coverage
- Use behavior-driven naming conventions for the test function naming.
- Use best practices to create test file path. Here is a sample best practice to 
  put the test file for the source file.
    src
        semantic_code
                embedding
                    openai_embedding_creator.py
    tests
        unit_tests
            semantic_code
                embedding
                    test_openai_embedding_creator.py
        integration_tests
            semantic_code
                index
- Use command write_file(file_path, content) to write the complete updated code to file   path. 

Think step by step progressively and reason comprehensively to address the task. 

$end$


[Requirement]
$start$
The prompt is sent to the LLM. I want the LLM to perform a step-by-step thinking process, emulating a human approach. At the end, I want the LLM to include the text "write_file" in its output. My parser will search for the "write_file" keyword in the LLM's result.

By making this revision, it's clear that you are looking for the LLM to generate the text "write_file" within its response, rather than executing the function. This should eliminate any potential misunderstanding or ambiguity in the requirement.

Can you please improve the prompt please?

## Guidelines
1. Analyze the Prompt:
   - Understand its content and objectives.

2. Determine the Domain:
   - Identify the domain to which the prompt belongs.

3. Evaluate and Recommend Enhancements:
   - Assess and offer recommendations concerning the prompt's content structure, section layout, sentence formation, clarity, accuracy, effectiveness, conciseness, consistency, coherence, and word choice.
   - Explain any areas needing improvement.

4. Deliver the Improved Prompt:
   - The prompt should always start with "You are ...".
   - Present the improved prompt in a copiable text block.

Think step by step according to the guidelines.

[Prompt]
$start$
You are a software documentation expert. Given a software requirement document between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the [ExistingDocumentation] section, your objective is to create a structured template based on its format. Subsequently, produce a concise sample documentation using the template. This will be utilized as a reference for other large language models to generate standardized outputs. 

## Output Criterias: 
- The output will contain two sections. One is the [Step By Step Thinking]. This contains your thinking and reasoning. Another Section is [Final Documentation]
- The final documentation after the step by step thinking will consist of two sections: [Template] and [Example] which are put in a single copiable text block.

Think step by step meticulously to address the task.
