You are the language expert. Your task is to first identify the domain of the provided prompt given in the 'Prompt' section, and improve the prompt to make it concise, clear, less redundant, at the same time keeps a good logical semantic order between words, and sentences.

Prompt:
```
You are language expert with a very strong logical thinking. Your task is to optimize the prompt given quoted by three backticks in the "Prompt" section.
```


This heuristic, step-by-step approach provides adaptable and flexible guidelines that prioritize reasoning and thought process over rigid structures. To detect errors, follow a similar reasoning process for each step. Use the provided example as a reference.

Example:

You are language expert with a very strong logical thinking. Your task is to optimize the prompt given quoted by three backticks in the "Prompt" section.


You will first articulate your understanding of my prompt,

When faced with a task, humans commonly follow a sequential approach, progressing from point A to point B through intermediate steps like C, D, and E. This method involves using reasoning to gradually move from one step to the next, resembling an ant's crawling journey towards its destination instead of a sudden leap from A to B.

For example we have created one step-by-step analysis approach for error detection.
1. Start by examining the error message, which you will find in the "Error" section. Use your analysis of this error message to generate an initial hypothesis about its cause. 

2. Subsequently, refer to the "ReferencedCode" section, examining the source code thoroughly and progressively. Your analysis should be broken down into several steps, rather than jumping to conclusions in a single leap.

3. In your response, clearly articulate the reasoning process behind each step of your analysis. Use the following structure as a guide: 

    "The error message indicates that the issue is caused by ____. Looking at the source code, we can see that the code performs ____, ____, and ____. These actions result in ____ , which is likely the cause of the reported error."

4. After identifying the source of the error, propose and implement a solution within the source code. Document any changes made clearly, explaining why each change is necessary and how it resolves the identified issue.

5. Finally, present the modified code in a copyable code block, ensuring the output is formatted appropriately for easy replication and application. 


Is there a similar approach employed by Vue3 Frontend Engineer who follows best practices of Vue3 to convert requirement into frontend codes, either by creating new files, classes, and functions, or by updating relevant existing code within given constraints? Instead of answering the question ,directly, please articulate your thinking process.


At last, please create a guideline which is distilled from your thinking process which resembles an ant's crawling journey towards its destination instead of a sudden leap from A to B.

You will use the progressive approach to improve the prompt

If you are looking for general guidelines to improve your writing, here are a few suggestions:

1. Clarity: Strive for clarity in your writing by expressing your ideas in a concise and straightforward manner. Use clear and precise language to convey your message effectively.

2. Grammar and Punctuation: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation rules to ensure your writing is grammatically correct. Proofread your work for errors and consider using grammar-checking tools or seeking feedback from others.

3. Sentence Structure: Vary your sentence structure to create a more engaging and dynamic piece of writing. Incorporate a mix of short and long sentences, and use transitional words and phrases to improve the flow.

4. Active Voice: Whenever possible, use the active voice in your sentences. Active voice tends to be more direct and engaging, whereas passive voice can make your writing sound more passive and less engaging.

5. Consistency: Maintain consistency in your writing style, tone, and formatting throughout your piece. Consistent use of language and formatting helps to create a cohesive and polished result.

6. Proofreading and Editing: Always proofread and edit your work before finalizing it. Take a break between writing and proofreading to approach your work with fresh eyes. Look for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing, and make necessary revisions.

7. Use of Examples and Evidence: When making a point or argument, support it with relevant examples, evidence, or anecdotes. This adds credibility and helps readers understand and connect with your ideas.

8. Read and Learn: Read widely in different genres and styles to expand your vocabulary, enhance your writing skills, and develop your own unique voice. Learning from experienced writers can provide valuable insights and inspire your own writing.

Remember, writing is a skill that improves with practice. By implementing these guidelines and continually honing your writing abilities, you can enhance the quality and impact of your written work.

1. Logical Flow: Ensure that your sentences are organized in a logical and coherent manner. Each sentence should flow smoothly into the next, guiding the reader through your ideas in a logical progression.

2. Topic Sentences: Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea or theme of that paragraph. This helps the reader understand the purpose of the paragraph and provides a roadmap for what is to follow.

3. Chronological Order: If you are describing a series of events or presenting a process, consider using chronological order. This allows the reader to follow the sequence of events or steps easily.

4. Order of Importance: When presenting multiple points or ideas, consider arranging them in order of importance. Start with the most significant or compelling point and gradually work towards the less important ones.

5. Transitional Phrases: Use transitional words and phrases to create smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs. Words like "however," "therefore," "in addition," and "on the other hand" can help establish connections between ideas and improve the overall flow of your writing.

6. Coherence and Unity: Ensure that each sentence contributes to the overall coherence and unity of your writing. Avoid unrelated or tangential sentences that may confuse the reader or disrupt the flow of your ideas.

7. Revising and Rearranging: During the editing process, read through your writing and consider if the order of sentences can be improved. Look for opportunities to rearrange sentences or paragraphs to enhance clarity, coherence, and the logical progression of your ideas.

Remember, the specific order of sentences may vary depending on the content and purpose of your writing. It's important to consider the context and choose an order that best serves your intended message and engages your readers effectively.
