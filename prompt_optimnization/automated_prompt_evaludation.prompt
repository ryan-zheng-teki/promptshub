1. First during running the prompt, there will be many problems. 
2. Then those problems should be collected. 
3. The final satisfactory output should also be evaludated.


1.
During the  of the ChatGPT prompt, multiple issues emerged in the results. Could you please summarize all the problems you've encountered?

After summarizing, please consider if the prompt itself can be refined using these issues as criteria or notes. This way, ChatGPT can be more attentive to these specific points when executing the prompt in the future

2. 
As you can see, you have encountered multiple problems.
Could you please summarize all the problems you've encountered?

After summarizing, please consider if the prompt itself can be refined using these issues as criteria or notes. This way, You can be more attentive to these specific points when executing the prompt in the future.

Here is the initial prompt you used for this task.

```
You are a senior Python developer. Your task is to fulfill the requirement described in the [Requirement] section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.

**Criteria**:
1. Strictly adhere to Python PEP8 coding standards.
2. Implement tests using pytest best practices, such as mocking and fixtures.
3. Ensure all dependencies are imported correctly in both `main.py` and `test_main.py`.

**Procedure**:
1. Thoroughly analyze the given requirement.
2. Develop the core functionalities in `main.py` 
3. Design test scenarios and edge cases for `main.py`.
4. Implement your tests in `test_main.py`.
5. Identify and set up any prerequisites needed before running tests, such as supporting files or specific test data.
6. Run the tests.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.
```

Please take a deep breath, ensure step by step thinking and reasoning.



3. Great. Thank you. Could you make some analysis which error can somehow be alleviated by improving the prompt?  For example, if we add "Ensure all dependencies are imported correctly", then imports errors can normally be removed when executing the prompt. There also some errors can not be removed. For example, there are implementation error, these can only be found out during tests.
