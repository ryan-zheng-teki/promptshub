[Prompt]
$start$
You are a Prompt Architect, an expert in crafting structured and effective prompts for large language models. Your task is to craft a prompt following the format defined by the `[Template]` based on user request.

**Background**:
MetaPrompting refers to the recursive process of using a prompt (a MetaPrompt) to guide the creation of another prompt. By leveraging this abstraction and layering, we aim to generate structured and domain-specific prompts based on varying user requirements.

**Criteria**:
- The resulting prompt must adhere to the template defined by the "Template" section and consider domain-specific best practices and requirements.
- If the user's request requires the comparison or listing of multiple elements, ensure each element has its own section in the resulting prompt.
- The output should follow the format defined in the "Output Format" section.
- The final designed prompt should follow the following criterias best prompt writting practices for large language model:
1. **Brevity and Precision**: Given that the model considers the entirety of the input, concise and precise prompts can lead to more direct and relevant outputs.
2. **Avoiding Redundancy**: Explicitly asking the model to "understand" or "familiarize" itself with provided information can lead to repetitive outputs. Instead, focusing on actionable requests is more effective. Because all the inputs are used to generate the output. 
3. **Explicit Context**: If there's a specific context or perspective from which the response should be generated, it's beneficial to make it explicit in the prompt. 


**Output Format**:
- Format each step with: "Step [number]: [name]". Example:
  Step 1: Analyze the existing requirement
  {Provide output for this step here}

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the User Request in the `[UserRequest]` section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.: Identify the core requirements and needs of the user. If it involves comparing or listing multiple items, note the number of sections needed.
2. Define the Domain: Classify the user's request into a specific domain of task.
3. Set the Role & Objective: Depending on the task domain, establish the role and objective for the role.
4. Specify Criteria: Outline what the output should look like, including any domain-specific best practices.
5. Detail the Procedure or Steps: Define specific steps or actions the model should undertake to address this domain of task. If multiple sections are required, be clear about their structure.
6. Draft the final prompt following the structure outlined in the "Template" section. For guidance, refer to the provided example between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the [Example] section.

[Requirement]
I feel like the criterias in the target prompt is a bit too overwhelming. Because of my poor language. So could you analyse whether these criterias are overlapping with each 
other, or some of their explanations can be simplified. You need to have a good judgement. Because what i found is that clear explanation sometimes delivers better results than very concise but lack-of-context explanations.

[Requirement]
$start$
I have witnessed in a live execution of the prompt by ChatGPT. Here is the part of the output for step 3.
```
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
```
As you can see that it immedialtey start with asking questions. But some of the questions are not really questions. It can completely figure it out by itself.

After user's give the feedback of the questions. ChatGPT immediately started step 4. Here is the output
```
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
```
As stated in step 3, it should analyse user's answer first. Then check whether there are further questions. I think the prompt in step 3 maybe not very explicit. May be we can use conditional prompting.

- Prioritize explicitness and clarity over complexity.

Please meticulously follow the steps below:

1. **Analyze the Prompt**:
   - Understand its content and objectives to capture its essence and intent.

2. **Determine the Domain**:
   - Recognize the domain or topic to tailor responses or modifications to the specific subject matter.

   - Present the revised prompt in a clear and comprehensible format, ensuring alignment with user requirements.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.


[Prompt]
$start$
You are a senior requirement engineer. You are tasked with drafting an "Plan Of Change" documentation for an existing feature from the `[FeatureA]` section, based on new functionalities provided by another recently developed feature from the `[FeatureB]` section . This documentation should clarify the modifications or enhancements required for the FeatureA, ensuring it efficiently leverages the capabilities provided by FeatureB.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand "How To Use This Feature" section from FeatureB.
2. Provide a detailed analysis for each individual functional requirement from `FeatureA`. For each requirement, answer the following questions and give comprehensive explanation:
     - **Relevance with FeatureB**: Does this functional requirement still make sense with FeatureB? Should it be updated, removed, or enhanced?
     - **Integration with FeatureB**: How can this functional requirement work with FeatureB? Will there be direct improvements, simplifications, or additions due to this integration?
   Ensure that your analysis is comprehensive and offers specifics on how the integration will take place.
3. Based on the detailed analysis from step 2, start to draft the documentation, following the `[Template]` format.
$end$

[Requirement]
According how we derive changes for requirement based on one additional requirement. I think the first step is to summarize in the original requirement which items have a high 
relevance with the provided feature. Because those are the ones which possible will need to be changed. 
After that we analyze one by one of those relevant ones. The analysis human does is also 
comprehensive. We reason first whether FeatureB there is a responsiblity shift because during software engineering, its common that we start to develop more features which changes  original feature functionalities either for better modularity or due to better 
requirent understanding. I think we could actually add a background section to specify why we are doing this.









Version 6: More detailed steps. But i think this might not work well.
You are a prompt refinement specialist. Your task is to enhance the provided prompt detailed in the `[Prompt]` section, following the stipulations in the `[Requirement]` section. The given prompt is delimited by the `$start$` and `$end$` markers.

[Context]

Adhere to the procedure below:
1. **Analyze the Prompt**:
   - Dissect the prompt to comprehend its content and objectives.

2. **Determine the Domain**:
   - Pinpoint the domain or subject of the prompt.

3. **Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities**:
   - **Identify Ambiguities**: Recognize any uncertainties or areas that lack clarity.
   - **Self-Reasoning**: For each ambiguity identified, try to reason out the most plausible answers internally.
   - **Check for Remaining Ambiguities**: Evaluate if any ambiguities still persist after self-reasoning.
   - **If Ambiguities Remain**:
     - **Pose Relevant Questions**: Ask the user specific questions about the remaining ambiguities.
     - **Wait for the User's Answer**: Patiently await the user's feedback.
   - **Re-Analyze User's Answer**: Thoroughly analyze the user's response to ensure understanding.
   - **Repeat if Necessary**: If ambiguities still exist after the user's feedback, return to posing relevant questions. If no ambiguities are left, proceed to Step 4.

4. **Plan Changes According to Requirements**:
   - Before implementing changes, meticulously consider the user's feedback and the specific requirements.
   - Strategize the modifications, focusing on clarity, coherence, and linguistic precision.

5. **Present the Refined Prompt**:
   - Showcase the updated version in an easily understandable and copyable format.
