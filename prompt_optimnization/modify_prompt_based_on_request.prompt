[Prompt]
$start$
**Role & Objective**
You are a senior software architect. You are tasked with drafting a "Plan Of Change" documentation for an existing "Module Specification" detailed in the `[ModuleA]` section, based on functionalities provided by another recently developed "Module Specification" in the `[ModuleB]` section. This documentation should clarify the modifications or enhancements required for ModuleA, ensuring it efficiently leverages the capabilities provided by ModuleB.

**Background**:
In the realm of software engineering, as systems evolve and new module specifications are developed, it's imperative to reassess existing module specifications to ensure their alignment with the latest functionalities. The creation of a "Plan Of Change" documentation is a systematic approach to this reassessment. Through comprehensive reasoning, engineers not only identify areas where module specifications can be enhanced or integrated but also recognize when certain functionalities may become redundant or need removal. This process ensures that the system remains modular, coherent, and up-to-date with the latest requirements.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand "How To Use This Module" section from ModuleB.
2. **Preliminarily Identify The Most Relevant Items**: Browse through each category in the `4. Specifications` section of ModuleA. For each category, summarize the specific specification items that have the most relevance with ModuleB. This step will form a detailed shortlist for a deeper analysis.
3. For each specification item shortlisted in step 2, follow the structured reasoning:

   a. **Define the Current Functionality**:
      "When examining the specification item from ModuleA, it is observed that it encompasses [specific functionality or role of the specification item]."
      
   b. **Introduce and Contrast with ModuleB**:
      "On the other hand, ModuleB introduces [specific capability or specification of ModuleB], which has the potential to [complement/overlap with/challenge] the aforementioned functionality of the specification item."
      
   c. **Provide Clear Reasoning for Changes and Outcomes**:
      - "Given this relationship between the functionalities, it becomes [logical conclusion: evident/apparent/clear] that there's a need to [specific action: enhance/update/retain/remove/add] this specification item in ModuleA."
      - If modifying: "The modified description for this specification item, considering ModuleB's capabilities, would be [new detailed functional specification description]."
      - If removing: "This specification item from ModuleA is marked for removal due to [specific reason relating to ModuleB]."
      - If identifying a new requirement: "A new specification item for ModuleA, influenced by ModuleB, would be [detailed description of the new specification item]."

4. **Identify New Specification Items**: Based on the capabilities of ModuleB, list out any new specification items that should be added under the appropriate categories in ModuleA to fully leverage the functionalities of ModuleB.
5. Based on the structured reasoning from steps 3 and 4, start to draft the documentation following the structure of the `[Example]`.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Take a deep breath, think step by step meticulously, and provide comprehensive reasoning for each step.

$end$


Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.

[Requirement]
$start$
I feel like there is quite much redundency in the "Role & Objective" and "Context" sections. Please simplify it, while without changing the intended information to be delivered.
$end$



[Requirement]
$start$
I would suggest to improve the explicitness of the "Preliminarily Identify The Most Relevant Items". 

Due to the structure of specifications in the documentation looks like this:
```
#### 5. Specifications:

5.1. **Functional Specifications**:

- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>
   - ...
   
- **<Category_2>**:
   - <Specification_2.1>
   - <Specification_2.2>
   - ...

<Continue listing categories and their associated specifications as necessary.>

5.2. **Technical Specifications**:

- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>

<Continue listing categories and their associated specifications as necessary.>
```

So the steps should go through each specification item under each category. Here the category means the category under either functional or technical specification. Because  if not make it clear, ChatGPT might think the category means 5.1 or 5.2. 
Since the numbering is fixed. You could think about a way to make the second step even more clear about where specification item is located.
$end$


Do you think its better to set the role as "You are a large language model performed as python software architect" or just "You are a Python architect"? Because if you read later, for large language model, it has context size limitation. The context size is the 
input plus output size of of the model. 

Actually the target user of the result will be ChatGPT. The result will be used by chatgpt to act as software architect to design modules based on requirement and architectural analysis. That's why the requirements has to be completely clear. Without completely clear requirements, it's not possible to design modules. 

Another point is, previously software developers are figuring out some software requirements during developments. However, now ChatGPT will generate the majority of code. To generate complete codebase, the requirements have to be completely clarified, otherwise, ChatGPT is not able to generate workable code.

Version 2: 
You are a top prompt engineer. Your objective is to update the given prompt defined in the `[Prompt]` section according to the requirements presented in the `[Requirement]` section. The given prompt is enclosed between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.

[Context]
Most of the prompt is well-written, but only some minor parts can be improved.
The optimized prompt will be used by large language model like ChatGPT.

[Criteria]
- Avoid excessive optimization. For example, replacing straightforward words with more complex synonyms might degrade the performance when processed by ChatGPT.
- Prioritize explicitness and clarity over complexity.

Please follow the steps below:
1. **Analyze the Prompt**:
   - Dissect the prompt to understand its content and objectives.

2. **Determine the Domain**:
   - Identify the domain or topic of the prompt.

3. **Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities**:
   - If ambiguities are detected in the user's requirement, pose questions to the user for clarity.
   - **Wait** for the user's answers. Do not proceed without their response.
   - After receiving answers, analyze whether ambiguities still exist.
   - Continue this dialogue until all ambiguities are addressed and resolved.

4. **Plan Changes According to Requirements**:
   - Strategize the changes based on the clarified requirements, ensuring clarity, coherence, and linguistic accuracy.

5. **Submit the Refined Prompt**:
   - Present the updated version in a format that's easy to copy and understand.

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.




You know sometimes when featureA starts to use featureB. Because in software engineering, we start to develop our software with more modularity overtime. So featureA is developed earlier. featureB is developed later. FeatureB can start to manage some functionality for featureA for example. So there could be previously which were done in featureA which could 
be invalid, or could be inappropriate, or could already be responsibility-shifted to 
featureB. So the analysis should be be done like a human. The analysis should be comprehensive, and also logical deduction about how featureA will be in the future. But the second step in 'Procedure' seems not doing it very well. I will show you one output from ChatGPT for one example which i used the prompt. Here is part of the result. 

```
Step 2: Go through each functionality of FeatureA, and analyze what changes are needed in order to use FeatureB.
FeatureA is the Automated Coding Workflow System (ACWS). Let's analyze its functionalities and see how we can integrate FeatureB:

Step Definition:
Steps are represented by instances of a class derived from BaseStep, and each step constructs a unique ID, dynamic prompt, and processes the LLM API response.
Change Analysis: Since steps involve constructing dynamic prompts and processing LLM API responses, integrating with FeatureB's versioning mechanism will enhance the efficiency of these steps. Each step type (or class derived from BaseStep) should define its default prompt, and then the versioning mechanism can handle the creation and management of versioned prompts.
```
The result analysis for step definition is actually correct. For example, since each step involve to construct a dynamic prompt. With featureB, each step will define its own default prompt. If we think further, of course, after defining its own default prompt, then each step no longer need to define its dynamic prompt. But ChatGPT only analyse what is influenced. It does not go a bit further to analyse, after integrating it, some old functionality probably also need to be removed, because responsiblities shift.

[UserRequest]
{here place the user request}

[Requirement]
I feel like the criterias in the target prompt is a bit too overwhelming. Because of my poor language. So could you analyse whether these criterias are overlapping with each 
other, or some of their explanations can be simplified. You need to have a good judgement. Because what i found is that clear explanation sometimes delivers better results than very concise but lack-of-context explanations.

[Requirement]
$start$
I have witnessed in a live execution of the prompt by ChatGPT. Here is the part of the output for step 3.
```
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
```
As you can see that it immedialtey start with asking questions. But some of the questions are not really questions. It can completely figure it out by itself.

After user's give the feedback of the questions. ChatGPT immediately started step 4. Here is the output
```
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
```
As stated in step 3, it should analyse user's answer first. Then check whether there are further questions. I think the prompt in step 3 maybe not very explicit. May be we can use conditional prompting.

[Prompt]
$start$
You are a senior requirement engineer. You are tasked with drafting an "Plan Of Change" documentation for an existing feature from the `[FeatureA]` section, based on new functionalities provided by another recently developed feature from the `[FeatureB]` section . This documentation should clarify the modifications or enhancements required for the FeatureA, ensuring it efficiently leverages the capabilities provided by FeatureB.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand "How To Use This Feature" section from FeatureB.
2. Provide a detailed analysis for each individual functional requirement from `FeatureA`. For each requirement, answer the following questions and give comprehensive explanation:
     - **Relevance with FeatureB**: Does this functional requirement still make sense with FeatureB? Should it be updated, removed, or enhanced?
     - **Integration with FeatureB**: How can this functional requirement work with FeatureB? Will there be direct improvements, simplifications, or additions due to this integration?
   Ensure that your analysis is comprehensive and offers specifics on how the integration will take place.
3. Based on the detailed analysis from step 2, start to draft the documentation, following the `[Template]` format.
$end$

[Requirement]
According how we derive changes for requirement based on one additional requirement. I think the first step is to summarize in the original requirement which items have a high 
relevance with the provided feature. Because those are the ones which possible will need to be changed. 
After that we analyze one by one of those relevant ones. The analysis human does is also 
comprehensive. We reason first whether FeatureB there is a responsiblity shift because during software engineering, its common that we start to develop more features which changes  original feature functionalities either for better modularity or due to better 
requirent understanding. I think we could actually add a background section to specify why we are doing this.









Version 6: More detailed steps. But i think this might not work well.

[Requirement]
I think there is a lack of analysing user's request step if you look carefully 
at the steps defined. Steps 3 immedialtey asks for checking ambiguities. Before 
ChatGPT is able to check ambiguities, it should first analyse the user's request.
Then asks questions. However, actually a lot of questions can be solved by self-reasoning.
