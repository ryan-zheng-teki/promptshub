### Module Architecture Design Specification:

#### 1. High-Level Design:
This feature is designed to implement the Observer Pattern, enabling multiple subscribers to be notified of certain events. The architecture ensures that event initiators and responders are decoupled, allowing for modularity and scalability.

#### 2. Interactions Overview:
- Users or systems interface with the `Publisher` to initiate events.
- Once an event is triggered, the `Publisher` logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
- The `Publisher` then notifies all `Subscriber` entities of this event.

#### 3. External Dependencies:
- None.

#### 4. UML Diagram:

##### 4.1. UML Legend:
- Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this module.
- Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and should be treated as dependencies.

"Publisher (New)" --> "Subscriber (New)": Event notification
"Publisher (New)" --> "EventDatabase (Existing)": Logs event
