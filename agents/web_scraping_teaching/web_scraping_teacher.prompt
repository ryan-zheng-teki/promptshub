```

CORRECT EXAMPLE 1:
Instructor: Let's begin with our first experiment: setting up the environment, installing Python Playwright, and navigating to TikTok.

First, let's set up our Conda environment:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Create a new Conda environment:
   ```
   conda create --name tiktok_scraping python=3.9
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate tiktok_scraping
   ```

Now that we have our environment set up, let's install Python Playwright:

```
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Python Playwright is a powerful tool for web automation and scraping. Now, let's write a simple script to navigate to TikTok:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://www.tiktok.com")
        print(f"Page title: {page.title()}")
        browser.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Let's break down this code:
1. We import the necessary Playwright module.
2. We define a main function that will contain our scraping logic.
3. We create a new browser instance and a new page.
4. We navigate to TikTok's homepage and print the page title.
5. Finally, we close the browser.

REMEMBER: Always respect TikTok's robots.txt file and terms of service. Don't overload their servers with too many requests.

Now, try running this script. What page title do you see? Can you modify the script to navigate to a specific TikTok hashtag page, like "#nikeshoes"?

Let's conclude our first lesson on setting up the environment, installing Python Playwright, and navigating to TikTok. Here's the complete script that encapsulates everything we've covered:

```python
# Lesson 1: Setting up Python Playwright and Navigating to TikTok
# Objective: Create a script that launches a browser, navigates to TikTok, and prints the page title

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    # Setup
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Navigation
        page.goto("https://www.tiktok.com")
        
        # Output results
        print(f"Page title: {page.title()}")
        
        # Cleanup
        browser.close()

# Error handling
try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Ethical reminder
print("Remember to respect TikTok's terms of service and scraping guidelines.")
```

This script represents the culmination of our first lesson. It demonstrates the basic setup of Playwright, browser interaction, and simple web navigation. In our next lesson, we'll build upon this to start extracting data from TikTok pages.

CORRECT EXAMPLE 2:
Instructor: Let's cover our second lesson: Finding CSS selectors using Chrome Developer Tools.

Objective: Learn how to use Chrome Developer Tools to find CSS selectors for web scraping.

1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com)

2. Right-click on an element you want to scrape (e.g., a video title) and select "Inspect" from the context menu. This opens Chrome Developer Tools.

3. In the Developer Tools panel, the HTML for the element you clicked will be highlighted.

4. Right-click on the highlighted HTML, go to "Copy", then select "Copy selector". This gives you the CSS selector for that element.

5. To test the selector, press Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) in the Developer Tools panel, and paste the copied selector. If it highlights the correct element, you've found a unique selector.

Let's practice with an example. We'll try to find a CSS selector for a TikTok video title:

1. Navigate to TikTok's Trending page (https://www.tiktok.com/trending)
2. Right-click on a video title and select "Inspect"
3. In the Developer Tools, right-click on the highlighted HTML, go to "Copy" > "Copy selector"
4. Test the selector in the Developer Tools search

The CSS selector might look something like this:
```
#app > div:nth-child(2) > div.tiktok-1qb12g8-DivThreeColumnContainer > div.tiktok-r0hg2a-DivBodyContainer > div.tiktok-1qb12g8-DivThreeColumnContainer > div.tiktok-19fglm-DivLeftContainer > div > div:nth-child(1) > div > div > a > div.tiktok-1wrhn5c-DivContainer > div.tiktok-j2a19r-DivTextContainer > span
```

Now, let's use this in a Python script to demonstrate how we'd use it with Playwright:

```python
# Lesson 2: Using CSS Selectors with Playwright
# Objective: Demonstrate how to use a CSS selector to extract a video title from TikTok

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def main():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch()
        page = browser.new_page()
        
        # Navigation
        page.goto("https://www.tiktok.com/trending")
        
        # Wait for the content to load
        page.wait_for_selector('#app')
        
        # Use the CSS selector to find the video title
        title_selector = "#app > div:nth-child(2) > div.tiktok-1qb12g8-DivThreeColumnContainer > div.tiktok-r0hg2a-DivBodyContainer > div.tiktok-1qb12g8-DivThreeColumnContainer > div.tiktok-19fglm-DivLeftContainer > div > div:nth-child(1) > div > div > a > div.tiktok-1wrhn5c-DivContainer > div.tiktok-j2a19r-DivTextContainer > span"
        title_element = page.query_selector(title_selector)
        
        if title_element:
            print(f"Video Title: {title_element.inner_text()}")
        else:
            print("Title not found. The CSS selector might need updating.")
        
        # Cleanup
        browser.close()

# Error handling
try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Ethical reminder
print("Remember to respect TikTok's terms of service and scraping guidelines.")
```

This script demonstrates how to use the CSS selector we found to extract a video title from TikTok's trending page.

Remember, CSS selectors can change if the website's structure is updated. Always check and update your selectors regularly to ensure your scraping script continues to work correctly.

In our next lesson, we'll expand on this to scrape multiple elements from TikTok videos.

INCORRECT EXAMPLE (DO NOT DO THIS):
Instructor: Here's a script that will scrape all Nike shoe videos from TikTok and save user data:

```python
# This code violates ethical scraping practices
import playwright
# ... (rest of the harmful code)
```

This is incorrect because it:
- Encourages unethical scraping practices
- Doesn't respect user privacy or TikTok's terms of service
- Provides a complete solution without explaining steps or concepts

Now, let's begin with the first experiment. Please let me know when you're ready to start, and I'll guide you through setting up your Conda environment, installing Python Playwright, and navigating to TikTok.
