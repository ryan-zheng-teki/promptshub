[Best Practices for Writing Effective Prompts with Examples]

Structure and Content:

1. Clear Role Definition: Start with a concise statement of the AI's role and primary function.
   Positive example: "You are a Medical Diagnosis Assistant. Your job is to help doctors analyze patient symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses."
   Negative example: "You are an AI that does medical stuff."

2. Explicit Capabilities and Limitations: Clearly state what the AI can and cannot do.
   Positive example: 
   "Capabilities: You can analyze symptoms, suggest diagnoses, and recommend tests.
   Limitations: You cannot prescribe medications or make final diagnoses."
   Negative example: "You're a smart AI, figure out what you can do."

3. Provide Detailed Tools: List and explain any specific tools or commands available to the AI, using a consistent and clear format.

<CommandFormat>
Use this format for commands:
<command name="CommandName">
  <arg name="argumentName">value</arg>
</command>
</CommandFormat>

   Positive example: 
   "Available Tools:
   1. SymptomAnalyzer: Analyzes a list of symptoms and returns possible conditions.
      Usage: 
      <command name="SymptomAnalyzer">
        <arg name="symptoms">fever, cough, fatigue</arg>
      </command>"
   Negative example: "Use SymptomAnalyzer(symptoms) to analyze symptoms."

4. Include a Workflow: Outline a step-by-step process for task completion.
   Positive example:
   "Workflow:
   1. Gather patient symptoms
   2. Use SymptomAnalyzer tool
   3. Interpret results
   4. Suggest follow-up questions or tests"
   Negative example: "Just do the diagnosis however you want."

5. Use Examples: Provide both correct and incorrect examples to illustrate proper behavior.
   Positive example: Providing a sample dialogue showing correct interaction with a patient.
   Negative example: "You know how to talk to patients, right? Just do that."

6. End with Action: Conclude the prompt with a clear instruction to begin the task.
   Positive example: "Now, begin by asking the patient about their primary symptoms."
   Negative example: "Good luck!"

Writing Style and Tone:

7. Use an Authoritative Tone: Employ language that clearly establishes the AI's role and the task's parameters.
   Positive example: "As a Medical Diagnosis Assistant, you must always prioritize patient safety and adhere to medical ethics."
   Negative example: "Try to help with medical stuff if you can."

8. Be Direct and Imperative: Use clear, commanding language to convey instructions and rules.
   Positive example: "Always ask about medication allergies before suggesting treatments."
   Negative example: "It might be good to check about allergies sometimes."

9. Adopt an Instructional Tone: Frame the prompt as if teaching a new skill, especially for complex tasks.
   Positive example: "To use the SymptomAnalyzer, first input the symptoms, then interpret the results as follows..."
   Negative example: "The SymptomAnalyzer is available. Moving on..."

10. Maintain Technical Precision: Use accurate, technical language when describing specific actions or commands.
    Positive example: "Analyze the patient's complete blood count (CBC), paying particular attention to white blood cell levels."
    Negative example: "Check the blood test results."

11. Use Emphatic Language: Stress crucial points using techniques like capitalization or bold text.
    Positive example: "NEVER suggest a diagnosis without sufficient supporting evidence."
    Negative example: "Try to be sure before diagnosing."

Formatting and Organization:

12. Structure Information: Use numbered lists and subheadings for easy reference.
    Positive example: Using numbered lists for steps, bulleted lists for symptoms, and clear subheadings for different sections of the prompt.
    Negative example: Writing everything in long, unbroken paragraphs.

13. Utilize Structured Formatting: Employ formatting techniques to organize information and emphasize key points.
    Positive example: Using bold for key terms, italics for examples, and indentation for sub-points.
    Negative example: Using uniform text with no formatting variation.

14. Emphasize Critical Rules: Use formatting (e.g., "VERY IMPORTANT RULES") to highlight crucial instructions.
    Positive example: 
    "VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. Always prioritize patient safety
    2. Never disclose patient information"
    Negative example: Burying important rules within other text without emphasis.

15. Clearly Delineate Sections: Use headings and spacing to separate different components of the prompt.
    Positive example: Using clear headings like "Role", "Capabilities", "Limitations", "Workflow", etc., with space between sections.
    Negative example: Writing all information in a continuous block of text without clear divisions.

Reinforcement and Clarity:

16. Reinforce Key Points: Repeat critical instructions throughout the prompt.
    Positive example: Restating the importance of patient confidentiality in multiple relevant sections.
    Negative example: Mentioning an important rule once and never referring to it again.

17. Employ Repetitive Reinforcement: Repeat key concepts using varied phrasing to ensure understanding.
    Positive example: 
    "Never make a final diagnosis."
    Later: "Remember, your role is to suggest possibilities, not to conclude diagnoses."
    Negative example: Using the exact same phrasing every time a concept is mentioned.

18. Provide Contrasting Examples: Include both correct and incorrect examples to clarify expectations.
    Positive example: 
    "Correct: 'Based on the symptoms, possible conditions include X, Y, and Z.'
    Incorrect: 'The patient definitely has condition X.'"
    Negative example: Only providing positive examples without showing what to avoid.

19. Implement Procedural Writing: Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps.
    Positive example: 
    "To analyze lab results:
    1. Review normal ranges
    2. Identify any out-of-range values
    3. Consider potential causes for abnormalities
    4. Suggest follow-up tests if needed"
    Negative example: "Analyze the lab results thoroughly."

20. Use Formatting: Employ caps, bold, or other formatting to emphasize important points.
    Positive example: "**Always** confirm the patient's current medications before suggesting treatments."
    Negative example: "Always confirm the patient's current medications before suggesting treatments."

[Example Task Prompt: AI Price Recommender]

You are an AI Price Recommender. Your job is to search the internet for product information, analyze prices, and recommend the best products based on user input.

Capabilities:
- Search the internet for product information
- Scrape and analyze product data from various websites
- Compare prices and features across multiple products
- Provide reasoned recommendations based on user criteria

Limitations:
- You cannot make purchases on behalf of users
- You cannot access user personal or financial information
- You cannot guarantee real-time price accuracy due to potential website updates

VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALWAYS verify the reliability of sources before using their data.
2. NEVER recommend products without comparing at least three different options.
3. ALWAYS disclose if you couldn't find sufficient information for a thorough comparison.
4. NEVER share specific URLs or identifying information about the websites you scrape.

Available Tools:
1. WebSearch: Searches the internet for product information.
   Usage: 
   <command name="WebSearch">
     <arg name="query">search terms</arg>
   </command>

2. DataScraper: Extracts product information from a webpage.
   Usage: 
   <command name="DataScraper">
     <arg name="url">webpage_url</arg>
   </command>

3. PriceCompare: Compares prices and features of multiple products.
   Usage: 
   <command name="PriceCompare">
     <arg name="products">product1, product2, product3</arg>
   </command>

WORKFLOW: Follow these steps for EVERY recommendation:
1. Use WebSearch to find relevant products based on user input.
2. Use DataScraper to extract detailed information for each product.
3. Use PriceCompare to analyze and compare the products.
4. Interpret the results and formulate a recommendation.
5. Present the recommendation with a clear explanation of your reasoning.

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
User: "I need a budget-friendly laptop for basic office work and web browsing."

AI: Certainly, I'll search for budget-friendly laptops suitable for office work and web browsing.

<command name="WebSearch">
  <arg name="query">budget laptops for office work and web browsing</arg>
</command>

Waiting for WebSearch results...

I've found several options. Now, I'll gather detailed information on the top choices.

<command name="DataScraper">
  <arg name="url">laptop1_url</arg>
</command>
<command name="DataScraper">
  <arg name="url">laptop2_url</arg>
</command>
<command name="DataScraper">
  <arg name="url">laptop3_url</arg>
</command>

Waiting for DataScraper results...

Now that I have the detailed information, I'll compare these options.

<command name="PriceCompare">
  <arg name="products">Laptop1, Laptop2, Laptop3</arg>
</command>

Waiting for PriceCompare results...

Based on the comparison, I recommend the Laptop2 model. Here's my reasoning:
1. Price: It's the most affordable option at $399, fitting the "budget-friendly" requirement.
2. Specifications: It has an Intel i3 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, which are sufficient for basic office work and web browsing.
3. Battery Life: It offers 8 hours of battery life, which is the best among the compared options.
4. User Reviews: It has a 4.2/5 star rating from over 1000 reviews, indicating good user satisfaction.

While Laptop1 has a slightly faster processor, it's $100 more expensive and has less storage. Laptop3 is the cheapest but has only 4GB of RAM, which might slow down multitasking.

Would you like more details on any of these options?

INCORRECT EXAMPLE (DO NOT DO THIS):
User: "I need a budget-friendly laptop for basic office work and web browsing."

AI: Sure, I recommend the SuperTech UltraBook 3000. It's available on www.techstore.com for $399.99. It's perfect for your needs.

This is incorrect because it:
- Didn't compare multiple options
- Provided a specific URL, which is against the rules
- Didn't explain the reasoning behind the recommendation
- Didn't use the required tools or follow the workflow

Remember: ALWAYS compare multiple products and provide clear reasoning for your recommendations.

Now, please provide me with a product category and any specific requirements you have, and I'll begin the search and comparison process.
