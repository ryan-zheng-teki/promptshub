<Prompt Engineering Best Practices>
1. Mandatory Rules

1.1 Command Execution Protocol: Specify that the AI can ONLY interact using provided commands.
    Positive example: "You can ONLY interact with web pages using the provided text commands."
    Negative example: "You can use various methods to interact with web pages."

1.2 Waiting for Results: Mandate that the AI MUST STOP and WAIT for results after each command.
    Positive example: "After using a command, you MUST STOP and WAIT for the results."
    Negative example: "Use commands in quick succession to complete tasks efficiently."

1.3 Continuation Protocol: Emphasize that the AI MUST NOT continue until command results are received.
    Positive example: "You MUST NOT continue until you receive the command results."
    Negative example: "Feel free to proceed with the next step while waiting for results."

1.4 Result Indication: Require the AI to indicate waiting for results in a specific format.
    Positive example: "You MUST indicate that you are waiting by saying 'Waiting for [CommandName] results...'"
    Negative example: "Let me know when you're done with a command."

2. Structural Elements

2.1 Role and Task Definition

2.1.1 Clear Role Definition: Start with a concise statement of the AI's role and primary function.
   Positive example: "You are a Medical Diagnosis Assistant. Your job is to help doctors analyze patient symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses."
   Negative example: "You are an AI that does medical stuff."

2.1.2 Explicit Capabilities and Limitations: Clearly state what the AI can and cannot do.
   Positive example: 
   "Capabilities: You can analyze symptoms, suggest diagnoses, and recommend tests.
   Limitations: You cannot prescribe medications or make final diagnoses."
   Negative example: "You're a smart AI, figure out what you can do."

2.2 Tools and Workflow

2.2.1 Provide Detailed Tools: List and explain any specific tools or commands available to the AI, using a consistent and clear format.
   Positive example: 
   "Available Tools:
   1. SymptomAnalyzer: Analyzes a list of symptoms and returns possible conditions.
      Usage: 
      <command name="SymptomAnalyzer">
        <arg name="symptoms">fever, cough, fatigue</arg>
      </command>"
   Negative example: "Use SymptomAnalyzer(symptoms) to analyze symptoms."

2.2.2 Include a Workflow: Outline a step-by-step process for task completion.
   Positive example:
   "Workflow:
   1. Gather patient symptoms
   2. Use SymptomAnalyzer tool
   3. Interpret results
   4. Suggest follow-up questions or tests"
   Negative example: "Just do the diagnosis however you want."

2.3 User Input Handling

2.3.1 Clearly Denote Input Areas: Provide clear, designated areas for user input within the prompt using variables or placeholders that can be dynamically replaced.
   Positive example: 
   "<UserInput>
     <ProductCategory>{product_category}</ProductCategory>
     <PriceRange>{price_range}</PriceRange>
   </UserInput>
   
   In this example, {product_category} and {price_range} are placeholders that will be replaced with actual user input when the prompt is used. This allows for dynamic customization of the prompt based on specific user requirements."
   
   Negative example: "Tell me what product you want and how much you want to spend."
   
   Explanation: Using clearly defined placeholders or variables (like {product_category} and {price_range}) allows for easy identification of where user input should be inserted. This approach facilitates automated processing and ensures that user-specific information is correctly incorporated into the prompt. It also makes the prompt more versatile and reusable for different user inputs.

3. Content and Style

3.1 Writing Style and Tone

3.1.1 Use an Authoritative Tone: Employ language that clearly establishes the AI's role and the task's parameters.
   Positive example: "As a Medical Diagnosis Assistant, you must always prioritize patient safety and adhere to medical ethics."
   Negative example: "Try to help with medical stuff if you can."

3.1.2 Be Direct and Imperative: Use clear, commanding language to convey instructions and rules.
   Positive example: "Always ask about medication allergies before suggesting treatments."
   Negative example: "It might be good to check about allergies sometimes."

3.1.3 Adopt an Instructional Tone: Frame the prompt as if teaching a new skill, especially for complex tasks.
   Positive example: "To use the SymptomAnalyzer, first input the symptoms, then interpret the results as follows..."
   Negative example: "The SymptomAnalyzer is available. Moving on..."

3.1.4 Maintain Consistent Tone: Use the same tone and level of formality throughout the prompt.
   Positive example: Maintaining a professional, instructional tone from start to finish.
   Negative example: Starting with a formal tone and switching to casual language halfway through.

3.2 Language Precision

3.2.1 Maintain Technical Precision: Use accurate, technical language when describing specific actions or commands.
    Positive example: "Analyze the patient's complete blood count (CBC), paying particular attention to white blood cell levels."
    Negative example: "Check the blood test results."

3.2.2 Use Consistent Terminology: Stick to the same terms for key concepts throughout the prompt.
    Positive example: Consistently using "user input" to refer to information provided by the user.
    Negative example: Alternating between "user input," "customer data," and "client information" for the same concept.

3.3 Emphasis and Reinforcement

3.3.1 Use Emphatic Language: Stress crucial points using techniques like capitalization or bold text.
    Positive example: "NEVER suggest a diagnosis without sufficient supporting evidence."
    Negative example: "Try to be sure before diagnosing."

3.3.2 Reinforce Key Points: Repeat critical instructions throughout the prompt.
    Positive example: Restating the importance of patient confidentiality in multiple relevant sections.
    Negative example: Mentioning an important rule once and never referring to it again.

3.3.3 Employ Repetitive Reinforcement: Repeat key concepts using varied phrasing to ensure understanding.
    Positive example: 
    "Never make a final diagnosis."
    Later: "Remember, your role is to suggest possibilities, not to conclude diagnoses."
    Negative example: Using the exact same phrasing every time a concept is mentioned.

4. Organization and Formatting

4.1 Information Structure

4.1.1 Structure Information: Use numbered lists and subheadings for easy reference.
