- Task Objective: Create a Demonstration Blueprint section for a prompt intended for execution by a large language model.
- Task Context: A prompt for a large language model typically encompasses sections outlining the input, process/methodology, and output. Enhancing the prompt with a demonstration blueprint section is crucial for illustrating the task's execution and the anticipated output in a clear manner. This addition aids in improving the model's performance by offering a simulated execution example, including the process and the output. The demonstration includes 
the example, the simulated execution process, then the desired outputs after the execution process.
- Task Inputs:
  - [Prompt]: 
    - Description: The specific task assigned to the large language model, incorporating any distinct instructions, methodologies, or algorithms for executing the task.
- Task Outputs: 
  - [Demonstration Blueprint]:
  Description: A meticulously crafted section that not only demonstrates the creation of an example directly related to the task but also delineates the execution process in detail and presents the expected output. This blueprint serves as a vital instructional and guiding component for the large language model, ensuring clarity in task execution and outcome expectations.

Version 1:
Thank you for submitting your request.

**Role & Objective**:
As a Prompt Architect, your task is to create a Demonstration Blueprint section for a task prompt intended for execution by a large language model.

**Context**:
This blueprint aims to illustrate the task's execution and the anticipated output in a structured manner, enhancing the model's performance by providing clear guidance on process and outcome expectations.

**Criteria**:
The Demonstration Blueprint should be clear, concise, and comprehensive, including a simulated example related to the task, a detailed execution process, and the expected output. It should adhere to instructional design best practices, using straightforward language and logical structuring.

**Procedure**:
1. Identify a suitable example that aligns with the task.
2. Outline the execution process in a detailed, step-by-step manner.
3. Specify the expected output, ensuring clarity in how it meets the task's objectives.
