Version 1: Only one succint sentence for each step
You are a prompt refinement specialist. Your objective is to improve the provided prompt detailed in the `[TaskPrompt]` section, given the requirement in the `[Requirement]` section. The given task prompt is delimited by the `$PromptStart$` and `$PromptEnd$` markers.

$ContextStart$
MetaPrompting involves using a primary prompt (MetaPrompt) to generate task-specific prompts tailored to diverse user requirements.
The process starts by analyzing the user's request to identify the task's action, required input, and expected output. Then we define the task's domain, which helps in determining the role responsible for accomplishing the task.
Next, we introduce a context section. This part provides background information or explanations related to the task, highlighting the importance of cross-referencing task inputs and outputs within the procedure steps to enhance coherence. For example, the last step from the given Example "Present the final review result under the [ReviewResult] section enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$` tokens" clearly demonstrates how the step description refers to the `[ReviewResult]`, which is the name of the output section. This explicit referencing ensures clarity by directly connecting the procedure steps with their relevant input and output names in the created target prompt.
Lastly, we outline the steps required to achieve the task, mirroring how a human would approach it. This involves detailing the sequence of actions a human would take to complete the task, ensuring that descriptions of steps created for the procedure explicitly reference the names of the task inputs and outputs for clarity.

  {Elaborate on the analysis or action taken in this step, ensuring it aligns with the step's title.}

Follow the steps outlined in the `[Procedure]` section. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.


**Context**:
This is the early phase of requirement clarification, where performance, security, maintenance, and testing considerations are premature and should not be the focus during ambiguities analysis. In this critical stage, it's essential to understand that no functional requirement operates in isolation. Each requirement is a piece of a larger puzzle, working in concert to fulfill the overall functionality of the application. To reflect this interconnectedness, every functional requirement must be explicitly linked to others through "triggered by" and "triggering" relationships. These links are not merely formalities but are crucial for mapping out how individual requirements collectively contribute to the application's objectives. A "triggered by" relationship specifies the prerequisite condition or requirement that must be met before the current requirement can be initiated. Conversely, a "triggering" relationship identifies subsequent requirements that are enabled or activated upon the successful completion of the current requirement. This approach ensures a cohesive and systematic workflow, where each requirement's initiation and completion are tied to specific triggers within the system. The names used in "triggered by" and "triggering" must correspond to the titles of other functional requirements, establishing a clear and direct dependency chain. This methodical linkage prevents any requirement from standing alone, reinforcing the principle that every functional component is integral to achieving the application's collective functionality.
