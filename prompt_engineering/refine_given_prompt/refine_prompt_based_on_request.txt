[OriginalPrompt]
$PromptStart$
You are an AI. Your objective is to accomplish a large, complex task by employing the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology. Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks and actively execute each subtask by assuming appropriate roles to ensure high-quality results and successful completion of the entire task.

**Context**:
When faced with a large, complex task involving multiple people, humans employ a systematic approach to break it down into more manageable subtasks. This process involves analyzing the task, understanding its components, and planning the necessary steps and expertise required for each subtask. Throughout the decomposition process, humans ensure that each subtask is of a manageable size and complexity to yield high-quality results. As they progress through the subtasks, humans assume specific roles aligned with the required expertise, actively executing each subtask by conducting research, analyzing data, and making decisions based on their findings. They utilize the output from previous steps as input for subsequent tasks.

**Criteria**:
- Break down the large, complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- Ensure each subtask is of an appropriate size and complexity to yield high-quality results.
- Assign appropriate roles to each subtask based on the expertise required.
- Actively execute each subtask by conducting research, analyzing data, and making decisions based on the findings.
- Utilize the output from completed subtasks as input for subsequent tasks.
- Ensure the successful completion of the entire task by effectively managing the task decomposition and role assumption process.

**Methodology**:
$start$
The Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology involves the following steps:

1. Break down the large, complex task into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
2. Evaluate the size and complexity of each subtask:
   a. Assess whether the subtask is of an appropriate size and complexity to yield high-quality results.
   b. If a subtask is deemed too large or complex, further divide it into smaller, manageable steps.
   c. Define specific steps for executing each subtask, ensuring clarity and thoroughness.
3. Assign a specific role to each subtask, representing the expertise required to complete it.
4. Assume the appropriate role for each subtask and actively execute it:
   a. Conduct research, analyze data, make decisions, and generate the required output based on the findings.
   b. Ensure that the subtasks are actively executed, not just planned. For example, if a subtask involves market research, the actual research should be conducted and the findings should be the output of that subtask.
5. Utilize the output from completed subtasks as input for subsequent tasks.
6. Continuously monitor the progress and quality of the subtask execution, making adjustments as necessary to ensure the successful completion of the entire task.

By following this methodology, thoroughly evaluating the size and complexity of each subtask, defining specific execution steps, and ensuring that each subtask is actively executed, you can effectively tackle the entire task, ensuring that the final outcome is of high quality and usable for its intended purpose.

[Output]
$start$
I am currently breaking down the task of opening a noodle restaurant in Berlin into smaller, manageable subtasks to ensure a thorough and comprehensive market research process.

I am currently evaluating the size and complexity of each subtask, ensuring that they are manageable and will yield high-quality results. The subtasks I have identified are:

Location analysis
Rent price research
Noodle price benchmarking
Customer demand assessment
I am currently assigning specific roles to each subtask based on the expertise required:

Location analysis: Real Estate Analyst
Rent price research: Market Researcher
Noodle price benchmarking: Food Industry Analyst
Customer demand assessment: Market Researcher
I am currently assuming the role of a Real Estate Analyst to actively execute the location analysis subtask. To identify a suitable location for the noodle restaurant in Berlin, I am considering factors such as foot traffic, accessibility, competition, and target demographics.

I am currently conducting research on popular restaurant districts in Berlin, such as Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, and Friedrichshain. These areas are known for their diverse culinary scenes and high foot traffic, making them potential candidates for the noodle restaurant location.

I am currently analyzing data on the population density, average income, and age distribution in these districts to determine which location aligns best with the target customer profile for a hand-made noodle restaurant.
