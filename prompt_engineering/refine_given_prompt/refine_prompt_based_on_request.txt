  {Elaborate on the analysis or action taken in this step, ensuring it aligns with the step's purpose.}

Follow the steps outlined in the `[Procedure]` section. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.


[OriginalPrompt]
$PromptStart$
As a Requirements Engineer, your objective is to analyze the given functional requirements and restructure them according to the specified `[FunctionalRequirementTemplate format]`.

**Context**:
Functional requirements describe activities the system needs to perform. Each requirement can have inputs, outputs or both. Therefore, the format  defined by `[FunctionalRequirementTemplate]` aims to standardize documentation practices, by outlining the inputs, processes and outputs aims to improve clarity, consistency and completeness across requirements. This format will help identify what the requirement does, what inputs it needs, and what outputs it produces.

[FunctionalRequirementTemplate]:
### Functional Requirement Template
1. **Requirement Name**: A short name of the requirement
2. **Input(s)**: Description of the input(s) required for the requirement. Mark as None if no input.
3. **Process**: Detailed description of the process or functionality
4. **Output**: The expected result or output produced by the process. Mark as none if no output.

**Criteria**:
1. **Clarity**: Each requirement must be documented in a way that is easily understandable, avoiding technical jargon or ambiguity.
2. **Consistency**: The structured template must be used uniformly across all requirements, ensuring a standardized documentation approach.
3. **Comprehensiveness**: Ensure that all aspects of each requirement, including inputs, processes, and outputs, are thoroughly documented. If a requirement lacks explicit inputs or outputs, these should be noted as none.

**Methodology: Functional Requirement Transformation Algorithm**
1. **Initialize**: Start with the list of all functional requirements given in the [UserRequirements] section.
2. **Loop through each functional requirement**: For each functional requirement, perform the following steps:
   - **Understand**: Analyze the requirement to fully grasp its purpose, inputs, process, and intended outputs.
   - **Transform**: Apply the `[FunctionalRequirementTemplate]` to restructure the requirement. Specifically:
     - **Input Analysis**: Identify any inputs the requirement takes. If there are no inputs, mark this as none.
     - **Process Analysis**: Describe the process or functionality in detail, focusing on how the inputs are transformed or utilized.
     - **Output Analysis**: Determine the expected output(s) of the process. If there are no outputs, mark this as none.
3. **Repeat**: Continue until all functional requirements have been analyzed and documented according to the template.

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Begin each analysis with: "I am analyzing the requirement...", to simulate the algorithmic thought process in an iterative manner. This highlights the recursive nature of analyzing each functional requirement individually.

- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each functional requirement is fully analyzed.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of analysis of the current requirement while maintaining this conversational tone.
- Reasoning When Necessary: For actions or tasks that involve complexity or require decision-making, include reasoning to precede the output. This simulates the human cognitive process of thinking through a problem before arriving at a solution, ensuring that the output is not only precise but also well-considered.

Please Follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

$start$
The OutputRules should be slightly updated. The OutputRules was designed for executing steps of procedure. Now it should be updated to reflect algorithm execution from the Methodology section. I believe the update will be minor.
$end$


Version 8: With System 1, and System 2 thinking.
You are a prompt refinement specialist. Your objective is to enhance the provided prompt detailed in the `[OriginalPrompt]` section, given the requirement in the `[Requirement]` section. The given prompt is delimited by the `$PromptStart$` and `$PromptEnd$` markers.

[Context]
Most of the prompt is well-written, but some minor parts can be improved. The optimized prompt will be used by a large language model like ChatGPT. It is essential that the prompt is clear and direct, prioritizing these qualities over ambiguity and vagueness. In this process, we employ System 1 and System 2 thinking patterns. System 1 thinking is fast, intuitive, and often emotional, leading to quick decisions. System 2 thinking is slower, more logical, and deliberate, involving detailed analysis and reasoning.

[Criteria]
- Avoid excessive optimization. For instance, substituting simple words with complex synonyms may hinder performance when processed by ChatGPT.
- Prioritize explicitness and clarity over complexity.
