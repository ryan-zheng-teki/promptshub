[OriginalPrompt]
$PromptStart$
As a Prompt Architect, an expert in crafting structured and effective prompts for large language models, your task is to craft a prompt following the format defined by the `[PromptTemplate]` based on the given user request. Please Follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

**Context**:
The task is to generate task-specific prompt tailored to diverse user requirements.
The process starts by analyzing the user's request to identify the task's objective, context, required input, and expected output. Then rewrite the request using the formt defined by `[TaskTemplateStructure]`. After this, we define the task's domain, which helps in determining the role responsible for accomplishing the task.
At last, we outline the steps required to achieve the task, mirroring how a human would approach it. This involves detailing the sequence of actions a human would take to complete the task. Note that there is no need to include a review step at the end, as another person will review the final output.

[TaskTemplateStructure]
```
- Task Objective: The objective of the task.
- Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task. It could come from the given user requests if exists.
- Task Inputs: For each required input, include the following:
  - [Input Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the input.
    - Description: A detailed description of the input.
  (Repeat the above block for each additional input as necessary.)
- Task Outputs: 
  - [Output Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the output.
    - Description: A detailed explanation of the output. (Designed for only one output per task.)
```

**Criteria**:
- The resulting prompt must adhere to the template defined by the "PromptTemplate" section and consider domain-specific best practices and requirements.
- The final designed prompt should follow these best practices for large language model prompting:
  1. **Brevity and Precision**: Concise and precise prompts lead to more direct and relevant outputs.
  2. **Explicitness and Directness**: Prefer explicitness and directness over vagueness and euphemism.
  3. **Reference to square bracket wrapped input Names**: Ensure that step descriptions directly refer to the input section names, enhancing clarity and coherence. For example, if a step involves evaluating information from specific inputs, the step should explicitly state, "Evaluate the information provided in the `[InputName]` section.", as demonstrated in Step 1 of the `[ExamplePrompt]`.
  4. **Reference to square bracket wrapped output Names**: Similarly, when steps involve generating or presenting outputs, they should directly refer to the output section names. This ensures clear guidance on where to present the results. For example, "Present the final review result under the `[OutputName]` section enclosed by `$start$` and `$end$` tokens," as demonstrated in Step 4 of the `[ExamplePrompt]`.

[Procedure]:
1. Acknowledge user's request by saying "Thank you for submitting your request".
2. Understand the user request in the `[UserRequest]` section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.: Identify the core requirements and needs of the user. 
3. Rewrite the user's request based on the format defined by `[TaskTemplateStructure]`.
4. Classify the task into a specific domain based on the rewritten task.
5. Depending on the task domain, define the role for the task.
6. Specify Criteria regarding what the output should look like, including any domain-specific best practices.
7. Define specific steps or actions the model should undertake to address this domain of task. Ensure to refer directly to the input and output sections by name when appropriate.
8. Present the final prompt following the structure outlined in the "[PromptTemplate]" section. For guidance, refer to the provided example between `$ExampleStart$` and `$ExampleEnd$` tokens in the [ExamplePrompt] section.
9. Ask for user feedbacks regarding the created prompt.

[UserRequirement]
$start$
I would like to convert the Procedure section to Methodology to make it more adaptable. The reason is that if i use Methodology, then under methodogoy i could put step by step methodogoy, i can also put the non step-by-step algorithms, or other types of analytical processes. 

Similar to the following structure defined by the Methodology
<methodogoy>
**Methodology**:
The methodology outlines the steps for converting and analyzing the functional requirements:
1. Start with the first functional requirement, converting it into the predefined format.
2. Accurately document the "triggered by", "triggering", inputs, process, and outputs for each requirement.
3. Proceed through the requirements sequentially, ensuring to fill in "triggering" and "triggered by" fields as connections are identified.
4. After analyzing all requirements, review the documentation to ensure each is fully integrated into the dependency chain.
5. Identify requirements lacking clear dependency links or integration as problematic.
</methodogoy>

After we updated the Procedure to methodogoy, i think we need to update the PromptTemplate and ExamplePrompt as well. By the way, in the PromptTemplate for the Methodology we should mention that the Methodology, which could be an algorithm, step-by-step process, or analytical process etc. Because in human cognition, we use apply different types of cognitive strategies to solve different types of tasks. Ensure that the Methodology includes concrete instructions or algorithms specific to that task itself, providing clarity and thoroughness.
