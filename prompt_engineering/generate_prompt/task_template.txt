- Task Objective: The objective of the task.
- Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task. It could come from the given user requests if exists.
- Task Methodology: Here is the methodology name mentioned by the user to solve the task.
  - Description: Outlines the specific strategies or algorithms to be employed in the task's execution. It details the algorithms used to achieve the objective using the methodology.
  - Example: This section provides a detailed example to demonstrate the application of the described methodology or algorithm. Starting with a specific scenario, such as a set of requirements, the example then applies the methodology to this scenario. For instance, in a dependency analysis algorithm, we begin with a defined set of requirements. The example then demonstrates step-by-step how the dependency analysis algorithm processes these requirements to identify all dependencies among them, detailing the logic and decision-making processes involved. This practical demonstration aims to showcase the effectiveness and application of the methodology in addressing specific aspects of the scenario to achieve the task's objective.
