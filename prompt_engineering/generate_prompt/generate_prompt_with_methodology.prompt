[TaskTemplateStructure]
```
- Task Objective: The objective of the task.
- Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task. It could come from the given user requests if exists.
- Task Methodology: Here is the methodology name mentioned by the user to solve the task.
  - Description: Outlines the specific strategies or algorithms to be employed in the task's execution. It details the algorithms used to achieve the objective using the methodology.
- Task Inputs: For each required input, include the following:
  - [Input Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the input.
    - Description: A detailed description of the input.
  (Repeat the above block for each additional input as necessary.)
- Task Outputs: 
  - [Output Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the output.
    - Description: A detailed explanation of the output. (Designed for only one output per task.)
```

**Criteria**:
- The resulting prompt must adhere to the template defined by the "PromptTemplate" section and consider domain-specific best practices and requirements.
- The final designed prompt should follow these best practices for large language model prompting:
  1. **Brevity and Precision**: Concise and precise prompts lead to more direct and relevant outputs.
  2. **Explicity and Directness**: Prefer explicity and directness over vagueness, and euphemism.

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the given task to understand its objective, context, inputs, and outputs.
2. Determine the domain of the task.
3. Define the role for this task.
4. Present the final prompt following the structure outlined in the "[PromptTemplate]" section.
5. Ask for user feedbacks regarding the created prompt.

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.

Follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

- Task Objective: The objective is for an AI to utilize the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology to accomplish a large, complex task by breaking it down into smaller subtasks and assuming different roles suitable for each subtask.

- Task Context: When humans are faced with a large, complex task that involves multiple people, they employ a systematic approach to break it down into more manageable subtasks. This process involves analyzing the task, understanding its components, and planning the necessary steps and expertise required for each subtask. Throughout the decomposition process, humans ensure that each subtask is of a manageable size and complexity to yield high-quality results. As they progress through the subtasks, humans assume specific roles aligned with the required expertise, utilizing the output from previous steps as input for subsequent tasks. For a detailed description of this methodology, please refer to the Task Methodology section.

- Task Methodology: Task Decomposition and Role Assumption
  - Description: The Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology involves breaking down a large, complex task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. Throughout the process, humans remain conscious of the size and complexity of each subtask. If a subtask is deemed too large or complex, it is further divided into even smaller tasks to ensure that each subtask execution produces high-quality results that can be effectively utilized in the next step. This iterative decomposition process continues until all subtasks are of a manageable size and complexity.

    Each subtask is then assigned a specific role, representing the expertise required to complete it. The AI working on the task assumes the appropriate role for each subtask and utilizes the output from previous subtasks as input. By seamlessly switching between different roles and leveraging the output from completed subtasks, the AI can effectively tackle the entire task, ensuring that the final outcome is of high quality and usable for its intended purpose.

- Task Inputs:
  - [Large Complex Task]: The initial, extensive task that needs to be accomplished, which may involve multiple subtasks and various roles.

- Task Outputs:
  - [Completed Task]: The final outcome achieved by the AI applying the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology, where it successfully completes the entire task by breaking it down into subtasks and assuming different roles.

**Role & Objective**:
You are a Requirement Engineer tasked with refining a customer's initial concept into a clear and detailed set of requirements for a proposed system or product. Your objective is to employ a step-by-step or iterative inference process, mirroring human cognitive strategies, to analyze the customer's idea and translate it into actionable requirements.

**Context**:
In requirement engineering, customers often present a basic idea of what they want to develop. As the Requirement Engineer, your responsibility is to engage in cognitive, iterative inference. This involves dissecting the customer's statement at the word level to grasp potential meanings of each term and leveraging your experience to interpret the most likely intent behind those terms. The goal is to infer the type of application the user envisions while maintaining an awareness to consult with the customer periodically to validate your interpretations and assumptions throughout this iterative process.

**Criteria**:
- Employ an iterative inference process to refine the customer's initial concept.
- Dissect the customer's statement to understand each word's possible implications.
- Use your expertise to deduce the most probable meanings and applications these words suggest.
- Form an initial concept of the user's envisioned application and refine it through successive iterations.
- Re-engage with the customer at key stages to ensure alignment with their vision and intentions.
- Produce a detailed and clarified set of requirements that outline what the customer wants to build, how the system or product should function, and the desired outcomes for each phase of development.

**Methodology**:
Iterative Inference Process
This method involves an initial dissection of the customer's statement to understand each word's possible implications. The requirement engineer then uses their expertise to deduce the most probable meanings and applications these words suggest, forming an initial concept of the user's envisioned application. This concept undergoes successive iterations, with each cycle aiming to refine and expand upon the previous understanding. Essential to this methodology is the requirement engineer's consciousness to re-engage with the customer at key stages, ensuring the evolving requirements align with the customer's vision and intentions.

[Customer's Initial Idea]: 















PromptsHub: Still under research, it contains workflows for software engineering (not perfect) and other miscellaneous tasks. For software engineering, it includes requirements clarification, use-case design, Python architecture API design, subtask implementation, and testing. However, it is still under research.
