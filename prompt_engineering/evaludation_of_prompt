[Conversation]

In a live test of the prompt, i have seen that in step 3, the output is not really satisfactory. Let me show you the conversation between ChatGPT and User starting from Step 3.
```
ChatGPT:
Step 3: Engage in a Dialogue to Resolve Ambiguities
Before making any changes, I'd like to clarify some points:

You mentioned that we should first summarize which items from FeatureA have a high relevance with FeatureB. Would you like this to be an additional step before the detailed analysis or a replacement for the first step in the existing procedure?
The "background section" you mentioned, would it be a preamble explaining the reason for the integration of FeatureA with FeatureB? Or would it serve a different purpose?
Do you have any specific format or points that you'd like to be covered in the background section?
Once we address these questions, I'll be able to provide a refined prompt that meets your requirements.

User:
1. I trust your skill to figure out the most reasonable approach
2. It is a section explaining why we are creating "Plan Of Change Documentation". Also how human does the comprehensive reasoning to make sure changes are complete, not just add, sometimes removal also possible
3. See point 2. But i think you have a profound knowledge how human does integration of another feature into another one. 

ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, I'll proceed with the next steps.

Step 4: Plan Changes According to Requirements
Changes to be Made:

Incorporate a Background Section: We'll start the prompt with a background section explaining the rationale behind creating a "Plan Of Change" documentation. This will set the context for the users and explain why and how human engineers consider comprehensive reasoning during software feature integration.
Summarize High Relevance Items: Before diving deep into the analysis, we'll have a step where we identify and summarize the items of FeatureA that have a high relevance with FeatureB. This will streamline the analysis process and ensure we focus on the most pertinent items.
Responsibility Shift Consideration: In the analysis step, we'll incorporate considerations about responsibility shifts due to the development of new features. This will ensure the integration analysis is holistic and accounts for changes in feature functionalities for better modularity and understanding of requirements.

ChatGPT:
 You are a senior python software engineer. Your task is to analyze user requirements and design python modules for these requirements.

Context:
Modular design in Python entails creating distinct modules for different functionalities, each in a separate file. During the design phase, the focus is on defining APIs, including the functions and classes necessary to meet user requirements. In Python, a module file can contain either a class or pure functions, depending on which design approach better suits the intended functionality. This decision is influenced by the programming style: object-oriented programming typically prefers classes, while functional programming favors functions. While classes can enhance code readability, functions may be more appropriate in scenarios where a class isn't necessary. It's essential to strike the right balance based on the specific use case.

At the design stage, methods within these classes or functions are not yet implemented, as the primary goal is to outline the structure and interfaces of the modules, rather than their detailed implementation. An initial development environment is set up with an empty entry file named `main.py`, serving as the starting point for the modular design. 


Criteria:
1. All APIs must have detailed functionality descriptions.
2. Follow PEP8 best practices for Python coding standards.
3. Adhere to Python clean code best practices: use business meaningful naming for classes, functions, variables etc.
4. Utilize design patterns where appropriate in the design.
$PromptEnd$

**Example**:
Positive Example:
- **User Authentication Module**: Provides functionalities for user registration, login, and password management. This module includes classes such as `UserManager` for handling user data and `AuthenticationService` for implementing authentication protocols.
  - Explanation: This example aligns with the criteria by focusing on a core aspect of many applications, user authentication, and security. It demonstrates the use of meaningful naming conventions for classes and a clear division of responsibilities within the module. The description also hints at adherence to design patterns, such as the Service pattern for authentication tasks.

Negative Example:
- **MiscellaneousFunctions Module**: Includes various unrelated functions like sending emails, generating random numbers, and parsing CSV files.
  - Explanation: This module violates several criteria, notably the lack of a coherent theme or purpose which leads to a scattered approach that can hinder maintainability and clarity. The naming does not convey a clear business or functional domain, and the grouping of unrelated functionalities suggests a misunderstanding of modular design principles, which emphasize cohesion within modules.
