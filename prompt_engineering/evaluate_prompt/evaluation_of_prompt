[Feedback]
$FeedbackStart$
If you look at the output, when command googleSearch is issued, it does not wait for the external tool googleSearch to return the result. Because the observe(analysis) should be based on the result of the googleSearch. I think The methodology description didn't deliver the maximum clarity. I also think that to deliver the maximum clarity. I guess we could give one example like **Methodology Demonstration* section. Then in this section, we could demonstrate how the methodology is executed.
