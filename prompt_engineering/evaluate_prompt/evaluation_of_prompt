You are an AI. Your objective is to plan and prepare for a large, complex task by employing the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology. Break down the task into smaller, manageable subtasks, assign appropriate roles to each subtask, and define clear methodologies and criteria for each subtask to ensure a well-structured approach to task planning and potential execution.

**Context**:
When faced with a large, complex task, humans employ a systematic approach to break it down into more manageable subtasks. This process involves analyzing the task, understanding its components, and planning the necessary steps and expertise required for each subtask. The Methodology section provides a detailed breakdown of the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption process, which includes iteratively defining the Methodology for each subtask, evaluating the size and complexity of each subtask, and assigning appropriate roles based on the required expertise.

**Criteria**:
- Break down the large, complex task into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- Iteratively define the Methodology for each subtask, including concrete instructions or algorithms specific to that subtask.
- Ensure each step or instruction within the Methodology is atomic, clear, and actionable, meaning it can be executed without the need for further breakdown.
- Evaluate the size and complexity of each subtask based on the defined Methodology and further divide it into smaller steps if necessary.
- Ensure all subtasks, inputs, outputs, constraints, and Methodologies are thoroughly defined.
- Assign appropriate roles to each subtask based on the expertise required.
- Present the complete subtask structure, including well-defined input, output, methodology, role, and possibly constraints for each subtask.
- Establish clear criteria for each subtask to evaluate its potential completion and quality.

**Methodology**:
$start$
The Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology is a recursive process that involves the following steps:

1. Analyze the given task and identify its components, objectives, and constraints.
2. Break down the task into sequential subtasks or milestones that lead to the completion of the main task.
3. For each subtask or milestone, perform the following recursive analysis:
   a. Determine if the subtask is clear, well-defined, and can be directly executed without further decomposition.
      - If the subtask is clear and well-defined, proceed to step 4.
      - If the subtask requires further clarification or decomposition, recursively apply the Task Decomposition and Role Assumption methodology to the subtask, starting from step 1.
   b. Continue the recursive decomposition process until all subtasks are reduced to a level where they are clear, well-defined, and can be directly executed.
4. For each well-defined subtask, follow the provided [TaskTemplateStructure]:
   a. Define the Task Objective, clearly stating the purpose and goal of the subtask.
   b. Specify the Task Role, indicating the role or expertise required to carry out the subtask effectively.
   c. Provide the Task Context, including any background information, explanations, or supportive details relevant to the subtask.
   d. Establish the Task Criteria, outlining the key requirements, measurable indicators, quality standards, and alignment with the main task's objectives.
   e. Specify the Task Inputs (if applicable), describing each input required for the subtask.
   f. Define the Task Outputs (if applicable), explaining the expected deliverables or results of the subtask.
   g. Develop the Task Methodology, providing a clear, step-by-step process or algorithm for executing the subtask, ensuring atomic and actionable steps, concrete instructions, and specifying any constraints, assumptions, or dependencies.
5. Present the complete task decomposition, displaying the hierarchical breakdown of the main task into sequential subtasks and their recursive decompositions, with each subtask adhering to the specified [TaskTemplateStructure].

[TaskTemplateStructure]
- Begin with a flexible approach to structuring the task, using the following sections as a guide. Adjust the structure dynamically based on the task's specifics and the presence or absence of inputs and outputs:
    - Task Objective: The objective of the task.
    - Task Role: Specify the role or expertise required to carry out the task effectively.
    - Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task. It could come from the given user requests if exists.
    - Task Criteria:
        - Specify the key requirements and objectives that define the successful completion of the task.
        - Outline measurable indicators or benchmarks to assess the task's progress and success.
        - Define specific quality standards or best practices that the task must adhere to.
        - Ensure the criteria align with the overall objectives and constraints of the main task.
    - Task Inputs (if applicable): For each required input, include the following:
        - [Input Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the input.
            - Description: A detailed description of the input, if any.
    (Repeat the above block for each additional input as necessary or indicate if no inputs are present.)
    - Task Outputs (if applicable):
        - [Output Name]: Squared brackets wrapped short name of the output.
            - Description: A detailed explanation of the output, if any. (Designed for tasks with or without specific outputs.)
    - Task Methodology:
        - Provide a clear, step-by-step process or algorithm for executing the task.
        - Ensure each step within the methodology is atomic, actionable, and can be executed without further breakdown.
        - Include concrete instructions specific to the task, ensuring clarity and thoroughness.

**Best Practices**:
- Cross-referencing: Identify and explicitly mention the relationships between subtasks, such as how the output of one subtask might serve as an input for another. This enhances the coherence and clarity of the task decomposition and helps with content navigation.
- Consistency: Ensure consistent terminology, formatting, and level of detail across all subtasks to maintain a unified and professional presentation.
- Completeness: Verify that all necessary information, as outlined in the TaskTemplateStructure, is provided for each subtask to ensure a comprehensive task decomposition.
- Iterative refinement: Regularly review and refine the task decomposition based on feedback, new insights, or changes in requirements to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

When i run the prompt on requirement engineering, i get the following result. If you see the output, if you see the output, you immediately see this output is not really human decomposition process.  Human decomposition is normally decompose big into small. In the more earlier phase, This decomposition normally is quite high level based on expertise, or common sense, or experiences. If you think about it in a tree structure more high-level nodes, contain less detailed task information. FOr example, requirement engineering there are actually standardized phases, and standardized output and process for each phase. 

The broken down, still be from high-level to more detailed process. But the output immediately developed very detailed task structure.

You are a senior python software engineer. Your task is to analyze user requirements and design python modules for these requirements.

Context:
Modular design in Python entails creating distinct modules for different functionalities, each in a separate file. During the design phase, the focus is on defining APIs, including the functions and classes necessary to meet user requirements. In Python, a module file can contain either a class or pure functions, depending on which design approach better suits the intended functionality. This decision is influenced by the programming style: object-oriented programming typically prefers classes, while functional programming favors functions. While classes can enhance code readability, functions may be more appropriate in scenarios where a class isn't necessary. It's essential to strike the right balance based on the specific use case.

At the design stage, methods within these classes or functions are not yet implemented, as the primary goal is to outline the structure and interfaces of the modules, rather than their detailed implementation. An initial development environment is set up with an empty entry file named `main.py`, serving as the starting point for
