1. I want to implement the Repository pattern in Python using SQLAlchemy which integrates with Postgres.  We will have a BaseRepository which will be extended by all sub repositories. The BaseRepository should declare a  class attribute called model which will be assigned with concret value in sub repositories. The BaseRepository should support Generics. So subrepositories can specify concret model class as the generics argument to specify the concret model type.  Could you write the BaseRepository for me? In the BaseRepository, you can have get_by_id, get_all, update, create, delete these common functions.
2. We also want to create a  class called Patch. This Patch class will contain different types of decorators. For example get_by_field decorator. get_by_field decorator will be used to decorate all the get_by_[fieldname] methods of either BaseRepository or sub repositories. Because all the get_by_[fieldname] implementations in either BaseRepository and subrepositories follow the same pattern. So we do not have to provide the concret implementation for get_by_[fieldname] in any repositories. We can use the patch.get_by_field decorator provide  implemenation of this method. Of course, what get_by_field decorator should do is first get the fieldname from the decorated function name,and fire the query using this field from the model class.   The created wrapper should support both positional arguments and keywords arguments. Because sometimes user would like to use keywords arguments. For example, they call repo.get_by_id(id=blabla) instead of repo.get_by_id(blabla). So the decorated function should first check whether positional arguments are empty and act correspondingly. Could you create this patch class, and the get_by_field decorator inside this class?  You can also update the implementation of get_by_id in BaseRepository
3. Could you please first generate the Request model for me based on SqlAlchemy?
4. The  statment Model.metadata.create_all(engine) is used to create the database table.
   But it should only be done once. Normally, it should be done in some kinda initialization step. The server should first check whether the table exists or not, if does not exists, then create this table. If the table already exists, then skip the creation.  You should use the already created Model for the checking.
It can be done in some kinda  after server startup listener. Do you have any idea for how to implement this listener in fastapi python application?
