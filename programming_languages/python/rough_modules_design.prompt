Version 1: This is not working very well. Because this prompt is not only 
creating the modules, but also listing all the APIs inside this module. However, 
the goal of modules design have to break the requirement into different modules. 
And layout the rough design of the modules. We will use another prompt to improve
previous modules.

It's not easy to 
Role & Objective:
You are a senior python software engineer. Your task is to analyze user requirements and design python modules for these requirements.

Context:
Modular design in Python involves creating distinct modules for different functionalities, each represented by a separate file. In Python, a module file can contain a class, or pure functions, depending on which design is more suitable to achieve the functionality. In the design phase, the focus is on defining the APIs - including the functions and classes necessary to meet user requirements. However, methods within these classes or functions are not implemented at this stage, as the primary goal is to outline the structure and interfaces of the modules, rather than their detailed implementation. An initial development environment is already set up with an empty entry file named `main.py`, serving as the starting point for the modular design.

Criteria:
1. All APIs must have detailed functionality descriptions.
2. Follow PEP8 best practices for Python coding standards.
3. Adhere to Python clean code best practices: use descriptive naming for classes or functions and parameters.
4. Utilize design patterns where appropriate.

[OutputRules]
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output.

Please think step by step to do the design for the user requirement. Your output should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.


Version 2: with a much longer context.
You are a senior python software engineer. Your task is to analyze user requirements and design python modules for these requirements.

Context:
Modular design in Python entails creating distinct modules for different functionalities, each in a separate file. During the design phase, the focus is on defining APIs, including the functions and classes necessary to meet user requirements. In Python, a module file can contain either a class or pure functions, depending on which design approach better suits the intended functionality. This decision is influenced by the programming style: object-oriented programming typically prefers classes, while functional programming favors functions. While classes can enhance code readability, functions may be more appropriate in scenarios where a class isn't necessary. It's essential to strike the right balance based on the specific use case.

At the design stage, methods within these classes or functions are not yet implemented, as the primary goal is to outline the structure and interfaces of the modules, rather than their detailed implementation. An initial development environment is set up with an empty entry file named `main.py`, serving as the starting point for the modular design. 

Criteria:
1. All APIs must have detailed functionality descriptions.
2. Follow PEP8 best practices for Python coding standards.
3. Adhere to Python clean code best practices: use business meaningful naming for functions and parameters.
4. Utilize design patterns where appropriate in the design.

[UserRequirement]
- **Application Type**: Python console application.

- **Configuration**:
  - The user will provide a correct `config.json` structure. 
  - `config.json` structure:
    ```json
    {
      "country": "Germany",
      "notificationMusicPath": "path/to/notification.mp3",
      "failureLabelCSS": "CSS_SELECTOR_VALUE"
    }
    ```
  - If the `config.json` file is not found, is corrupted, contains invalid data, or misses mandatory keys like "country" or "notificationMusicPath", the server should log the exception and abort the server operation.

- **Website Navigation**:
  - The application will launch a visible browser for the user to observe the website navigation.
  - Navigate to [https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen](https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen).
  - Click the "Termin Buchen" button.
  - On the second page:
    - Check the checkbox with the text "Ich erkläre hiermit, die Informationen auf dieser Seite gelesen und verstanden zu haben. Mit der Nutzung dieses Service-Angebots erteile ich meine Zustimmung zur Erhebung und Nutzung meiner persönlichen Daten.*".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - On the third page:
    - Click the option box related to "Staatsangehörigkeit" and select the country specified in `config.json`.
    - Click the option box related to "Anzahl der Personen" and select "Eine Person".
    - Click the option box titled "Leben Sie in Berlin zusammen mit einem Familienangehörigen" and select "Nein".
    - Click the box "Aufenthaltstitel - verlängern".
    - From the list of checkboxes that appear, select "Aufenthaltserlaubnis für eine qualifizierte Beschäftigung in der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - In case of navigation issues or if the website updates its UI and elements don't match expectations: 
    - The server should log the error in a timestamped log file named "error_log_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt" in a "logs" folder and abort the operation.

- **Check for Appointments and Notification**:
  - Continuously check for available appointments from 8:00 to 18:00.
  - Handle appointments as specified.
  - On finding an appointment, play an mp3 music file from the path specified in `config.json` as a notification. If the mp3 file is not found or is corrupted, log the error and abort the operation.
  - If no appointment is available, display a "Failure" message on the top of the website using the CSS selector provided in `config.json`.
  - Wait for 5 minutes before rechecking.

- **General**:
  - The application should operate autonomously once started.
  - Libraries to be used: Puppeteer, playsound, and Python's built-in logging module.
  - Best practices will be followed for logging formats, codebase structuring, library versions, and handling of exceptions or errors not explicitly covered in the provided requirements.













To design this Python console application, we need to divide the functionalities into distinct modules. Let's walk through the design, considering each major component of the user requirements.

### 1. Configuration Module (`config_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Handles the loading and validation of the `config.json` file.

- **Class**: `ConfigManager`
  - **Methods**:
    - `load_config()`: Loads the configuration from `config.json`. Raises an exception if the file is not found or corrupted.
    - `validate_config(config)`: Validates the loaded configuration, ensuring all mandatory keys are present and valid.

### 2. Website Navigation Module (`web_navigator.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages the navigation and interaction with the website.

- **Class**: `WebNavigator`
  - **Methods**:
    - `__init__(browser_instance, config)`: Initializes with a browser instance and configuration.
    - `navigate_to_site()`: Opens the specified URL.
    - `perform_initial_steps()`: Performs initial button clicks and checkbox selections.
    - `select_country(country)`: Selects the country from the dropdown.
    - `complete_form_submission()`: Completes the form based on the configuration.
    - `handle_navigation_issues()`: Logs navigation issues to the error log.

### 3. Appointment Checker Module (`appointment_checker.py`)

**Purpose**: Checks for available appointments and handles notifications.

- **Class**: `AppointmentChecker`
  - **Methods**:
    - `__init__(config)`: Initializes with the configuration.
    - `check_appointments()`: Continuously checks for available appointments.
    - `notify_user()`: Plays the notification sound.
    - `display_failure_message()`: Displays a failure message using the CSS selector.

### 4. Logging and Error Handling Module (`logger.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages logging of errors and information.

- **Functions**:
  - `setup_logging()`: Sets up the logging format and file handlers.
  - `log_error(message)`: Logs errors with a timestamp.
  - `log_info(message)`: Logs general information.

### 5. Main Execution Module (`main.py`)

**Purpose**: Serves as the entry point of the application, orchestrating the other modules.

- **Flow**:
  - Initialize the `ConfigManager` and load the configuration.
  - Setup logging using `setup_logging()`.
  - Initialize `WebNavigator` and `AppointmentChecker` with the loaded config.
  - Start the website navigation and appointment checking process.

### Considerations and Best Practices

1. **Adherence to PEP8**: All modules will follow PEP8 standards for code formatting and structure.
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Functions, methods, and parameters will have clear, descriptive names.
3. **Error Handling**: Each module will robustly handle exceptions, logging them appropriately.
4. **Modularity**: Each module will be responsible for a specific aspect of the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
5. **Design Patterns**: The design follows the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring that each module has a single reason to change.

By structuring the application in this modular fashion, we ensure that each component is focused, testable, and maintainable. This design also makes it easier to update individual parts of the application in response to changing requirements or issues.
