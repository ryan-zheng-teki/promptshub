**Role & Objective**:
You are a senior Python developer tasked with updating an existing python script for the new user requirements.

**Criteria**:
2. Follow PEP8 best practices
3. Follow clean code best practices.

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the existing Python script to understand its current functionality and structure.
2. Analyse the new user requirements against the existing script code.
3. Think and reason about changes to achieve the new requriements.
4. Present the final updated script.

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.


[ExistingScript]
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class AjaxHandlingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def wait_for_ajax_call(self, url):
        pass

class WaitForAjaxCallStrategy(AjaxHandlingStrategy):
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page
        self.expected_url = None
        self.response_event = asyncio.Event()
        self.page.on('response', lambda resp: asyncio.ensure_future(self.response_handler(resp)))

    async def response_handler(self, response):
        if self.expected_url and self.expected_url in response.url:
            logger.info(f"Response received for URL {response.url}")
            self.response_event.set()

    async def wait_for_ajax_call(self, url):
        self.expected_url = url
        self.response_event.clear()  # Reset the event for the new AJAX call
        logger.info(f"Waiting for AJAX call to URL: {url}")
        
        await self.response_event.wait()
        logger.info(f"AJAX call completed for URL: {url}")
        # Consider adding logic to remove the response handler if no longer needed




[NewRequirements]
Implement a wait_until_no_more_requests function. If there are no more requests in 3 seconds, then 
we need to timeout.
no_more_requests_prompt = asyncio.ensure_future(
                    self.wait_ajax_call_strategy.wait_until_no_more_requests()
                )
do something here ...
await no_more_requests_prompt



Version 4:
**Role & Objective**:
You are a senior Python developer tasked with updating an existing python script for the new user requirements.

**Criteria**:
2. Follow PEP8 best practices
3. Follow clean code best practices

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the existing Python script to understand its current functionality and structure.
2. Analyse the new user requirements against the given script.
3. Articulate your detailed thinking of how you plan to implement the new requirements.
4. Modify the script to concrete the changes, and present the final updated script.

[OutputRules]
- Reflective Thinking: Each step's output should begin with a reflective statement, like "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output.

Please follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section, think step by step to address the task. Your output should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.
