4. Modify the script to concrete the changes, and present the final updated script.

[OutputRules]
- Reflective Thinking: Each step's output should begin with a reflective statement, like "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output.

Please follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section, think step by step to address the task. Your output should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

[NewRequirements]
we have to improve the function click_until_session_timeout click_until_session_timeout. Actuall 
there are different options at this page. They are presented as different tabs. 
We have to enhance the check whether we are still on the same tab. The first step is 
the following css 
<li class="antcl_active"><div class="antcl_circle">2</div><span>Servicewahl</span></li>

When servicewahl tab is activated, then on this page there is another element at the same time.
<legend>Informationen zur ausgew√§hlten Dienstleistung</legend>

When we click the button, if there is available appoint, then we will jump to the second 
step, however, on the same page. The second tab element is 
<li class="antcl_active"><div class="antcl_circle">3</div><span>Terminauswahl</span></li>

So i think we need to create meaningful to check whether we are still on the service wahl tab.
