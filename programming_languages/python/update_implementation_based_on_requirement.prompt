**Role & Objective**:
You are a senior Python developer tasked with updating existing Python code to meet new user requirements.

**Criteria**:
1. Follow PEP8 best practices
2. Follow clean code best practices.

**Methodology**:
The methodology outlines the steps for updating the existing Python code:
1. Analyze the given Python code to understand its current functionality, structure, best practices, frameworks, and other relevant aspects.
2. Analyze the new user requirements against the existing Python code.
3. Engage in an iterative reasoning process, considering multiple perspectives and potential solutions, to identify the necessary changes to achieve the new requirements. Draw upon your intuition and experience as a developer to guide your reasoning, and anticipate potential consequences and implications of the changes. Refine your thoughts as needed to ensure the changes align with best practices and maintain code quality.
4. Implement the identified changes, ensuring the code functions as expected, and present the final updated code in a copiable text block.

[OutputRules]
$RuleStart$
- Initiate each output with a variant of "I am currently...", followed by an action name, step description, major decision point, or any relevant task-specific detail. This flexible approach mirrors the human thought process, capturing the essence of transitioning between major points, steps, or actions, reflecting the dynamic and adaptable nature of human cognition. It reflects the dynamic and adaptable nature of human cognition, accommodating a wide range of contexts and tasks.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Ensure a continuous and logical progression of thoughts, maintaining coherence throughout the discourse. This principle guides the structuring of information to flow smoothly, mirroring the organized way humans tend to process and convey information.
- Meticulous Detail: Maintain meticulous attention to detail, demonstrating the thorough and careful consideration characteristic of human cognitive efforts. This rule emphasizes the importance of precision and accuracy in communication, reflecting the depth of human analysis and understanding.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue. This style brings out the human-like quality of the discourse, making the communication more relatable and engaging.
- Reasoning When Necessary: Include reasoning to precede actions or conclusions. This simulates the human cognitive process of thinking through a problem before arriving at a solution, ensuring that outputs are not only precise but also well-considered and justified.
$RuleEnd$

Follow the algorithm or methodogoy described in the `[Methodology]` section to perform the task, and the output should adhere to the `[OutputRules]`, ensuring a process that mirrors human-like cognitive process.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class AjaxHandlingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def wait_for_ajax_call(self, url):
        pass

class WaitForAjaxCallStrategy(AjaxHandlingStrategy):
    def __init__(self, page):
        self.page = page
        self.expected_url = None
        self.response_event = asyncio.Event()
        self.page.on('response', lambda resp: asyncio.ensure_future(self.response_handler(resp)))

    async def response_handler(self, response):
        if self.expected_url and self.expected_url in response.url:
            logger.info(f"Response received for URL {response.url}")
            self.response_event.set()

    async def wait_for_ajax_call(self, url):
        self.expected_url = url
        self.response_event.clear()  # Reset the event for the new AJAX call
        logger.info(f"Waiting for AJAX call to URL: {url}")
        
        await self.response_event.wait()
        logger.info(f"AJAX call completed for URL: {url}")
        # Consider adding logic to remove the response handler if no longer needed




[NewRequirements]
Implement a wait_until_no_more_requests function. If there are no more requests in 3 seconds, then 
we need to timeout.
no_more_requests_prompt = asyncio.ensure_future(
                    self.wait_ajax_call_strategy.wait_until_no_more_requests()
                )
do something here ...
await no_more_requests_prompt



Version 4:
**Role & Objective**:
You are a senior Python developer tasked with updating an existing python script for the new user requirements.

**Criteria**:
2. Follow PEP8 best practices
3. Follow clean code best practices

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the existing Python script to understand its current functionality and structure.
2. Analyse the new user requirements against the given script.
3. Articulate your detailed thinking of how you plan to implement the new requirements.
4. Modify the script to concrete the changes, and present the final updated script.

[OutputRules]
- Reflective Thinking: Each step's output should begin with a reflective statement, like "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output.

Please follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section, think step by step to address the task. Your output should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.
