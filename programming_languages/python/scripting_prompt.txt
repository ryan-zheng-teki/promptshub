Version 4: Prompting Procedure.
**Introduction to the Prompting Procedure Programming**:

The Prompting Procedure Programming, born from the synergy between conventional programming and natural language, aims to provide a more structured approach to interacting with large language models like ChatGPT. The core principle behind its inception is the amalgamation of the logical precision of traditional programming languages and the comprehensibility of natural language. This combination ensures clearer instructions to the model, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of its outputs.

**Why the Need for the Prompting Procedure Programming?**:
While large language models are proficient in understanding and generating natural language, there are instances where unstructured prompts can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results. By introducing structured constructs like loops, conditions, and directives, the Prompting Procedure Programming aids in providing clearer and more defined instructions, effectively reducing the room for error.

**Language Elements and Their Descriptions**:

1. **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: A high-level command that sets the tone or provides overarching instructions for the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Ensures that the entire procedure follows a consistent set of rules or guidelines.

2. **DIRECTIVE**:
    - **Definition**: Specific guidelines or rules tailored for a particular action.
    - **Usage**: Provides a more granular level of instruction for actions, ensuring they adhere to specific conditions or requirements.

3. **Global Variables**:
    - **Definition**: Variables that are accessible throughout the entire procedure.
    - **Usage**: Initialized at the beginning of the procedure and can be utilized in any subsequent step or action.

4. **Step**:
    - **Definition**: Represents a distinct operation with a clear objective in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Used to signify a particular segment or phase in the prompting code.

5. **Action**:
    - **Definition**: A sub-component within its parent step that denotes a specific task to be executed.
    - **Usage**: Details out the exact operations to be performed.
    - **Example**:
      ```
      content, objectives = Action: DISSECT the promptContent TO grasp ITS content AND objectives
      ```

6. **IF and ELSE**:
    - **Definition**: Conditional constructs used to introduce a condition (IF) and provide an alternative course of action (ELSE).
    - **Usage**: Enables conditional execution of steps or actions based on specified criteria.

7. **LABEL**:
    - **Definition**: Marks a specific line or point in the procedure.
    - **Usage**: Acts as a reference point for JUMP directives.

8. **JUMP**:
    - **Definition**: Directs the execution to jump to a specified labeled line.
    - **Usage**: Used in conjunction with LABEL to control the flow of execution.

9. **EXECUTION PLAN**:
    - **Definition**: A structured sequence of steps or actions that outlines the flow and order of execution within a designated block.
    - **Usage**: Mirrors the cognitive process humans undergo when mapping out tasks before performing them.

**Current State of the Language**:
As of now, the Prompting Procedure Programming encompasses only the above-defined elements. There aren't any additional constructs or components introduced yet. This ensures simplicity and ease of understanding for users but also paves the way for potential extensions in the future, based on evolving needs and user feedback.

With the understanding of "Prompting Procedure Programming Language", now please perform as human brain who is going to execute the prompting procedure given in the `[PromptingProcedure]`.

[PromptingProcedure]

### **Automated Test Replicator**

#### **Objective**:
Automate the generation of unit tests in a Python test file based on a template method. The tests should be generated based on JSON filenames in a specified directory, but only for those JSON files that don't already have corresponding tests.

#### **User Inputs**:
1. **Test File Path**: Path to the test file where the template method is located. This is where replicated tests will be appended.
2. **Input Folder**: Directory containing JSON input files. Each file acts as data for a unique test.
3. **File Prefix**: Prefix of the JSON filenames to determine which files to consider for test replication.
4. **Output Folder**: Directory with expected JSON output results corresponding to each input.

#### **Script Actions**:
1. Scan the test file to identify the template method and find which input file it uses. This also helps in detecting tests that have already been generated.
2. Scan the specified input folder to locate filenames with the provided prefix.
3. Determine which input files do not yet have a corresponding test in the test file.
4. For each input file without a matching test:
    - Extract its suffix (e.g., `country_FR_city_Paris`).
    - Clone the template test method.
    - Within the cloned test:
        1. Adjust the test method's header using the extracted suffix.
        2. Modify the input file path in the test to match the extracted suffix.
        3. Adapt the expected results file path using the extracted suffix.
    - Append the new test method to the test file, directly after the template.
