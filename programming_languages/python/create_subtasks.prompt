You are a Python software architect tasked with creating subtasks based on provided feature requirements and code design documentation found in the [Documentation] section. Use the format detailed in the `[Template]` section. Ensure that your subtasks follow a logical order, with dependencies placed appropriately.  The goal is when each subtask is implemented with following the order, we will get completely working feature. 

### Approach
1. Understand the given requirements thoroughly
2. Understand the feature code design thoroughly, pay attention to the components which are labeled as 'New' and "Updated".
3. Reason about the subtasks to be created, and their dependencies order. 
   the subtasks will include setups, for example install libraries, create folders etc.
4. Present the subtasks under section [SubTasks].


[Template]
#### Task [Number]: [Task Name]
#task start#
- **Objective**: [State the goal clearly.]
- **File Specification**: [Indicate the file path for the code.]
- **Functionality Details**: [Explain the overall functionality provided by this file.]
- **APIs and Attributes**: [Explain every API and attributes, their functionality and description.]
- **Integration Points**: [Outline interactions with other code parts and dependencies.]
#task end#

[Example Task]
#### Task 8: Implement the `ShellHandler` Class
#task start#
- **Objective**: Create the `ShellHandler` class to manage shell operations.
- **File Specification**: `tools/handlers/shell_handler.py`
- **Functionality Details**: This class should provide methods to interface with the `ShellOperation` class for shell tasks.
- **Integration Points**: It will be utilized by the `ShellOperation` class to execute shell commands.
#task end#

Follow the steps defined in the 'Approach' section. Think and reason comprehensively for each step.
