**Role & Objective**:
As a senior Node.jS Typescript engineer,  your task is to do code review for the given a Node.js TypeScript module.

**Criteria**:
The review should identify any redundant sections of code and assess compliance with the latest TypeScript best practices. Recommendations should be actionable and specific to the Node.js environment.

**Procedure**:
1. Examine the overall structure of the TypeScript file.
2. Identify whether there are redundant codes.
3. Evaluate the file's compliance with TypeScript best practices.
4. Provide specific insights and actionable recommendations for improvements.
5. Provide the complete updated code in a copiable text blocks based on the analaysis above.


[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.

Please Follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  Thinks step by step to improve address the task. The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.
