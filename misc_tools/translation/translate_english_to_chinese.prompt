**Procedure**:
1. Understand the content, context, and purpose of the English prompt.
2. Translate the prompt into Chinese, focusing on accuracy and cultural appropriateness.
3. Adapt the structure to fit Chinese linguistic norms while retaining the original format.
4. Present the final complete translated prompt in a copiable text block.
