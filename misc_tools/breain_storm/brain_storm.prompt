I have a generic code design template, as you can see in the `[CodeDesignTemplate]` section. The current documentation utilizes a generic structure focusing on Components, Methods/APIs, and Attributes, typically interpreting 'Component' as Classes. However, Python's modular design involves distinct modules for various functionalities, each in a separate file. A Python module can encapsulate a class or pure functions, tailored to the required functionality. This necessitates adapting the conventional use of 'Component' to better suit Python's specific module-centric approach.


[CodeDesignTemplate]
### Module Code Specification Template:

#### 1. Document Context

- **Programming Language**: This specification is tailored for **Python**, emphasizing terminologies and structures inherent to Python. Some principles might apply universally, but specific details are Python-centric.
  
- **Terminology**: 
  - **Component**: A primary building block of the module. In Python, this can be a **Class** or a **Standalone Function**.
  - **Module**: A grouping of related functionalities. Distinct from Python's term, where "module" typically refers to a file.

#### 2. Module Architecture Design:

##### 2.1. High-Level Design
This module is designed to implement the Observer Pattern, enabling multiple subscribers to be notified of certain events. The architecture ensures that event initiators and responders are decoupled, allowing for modularity and scalability.

##### 2.2. Components Modifications

###### 2.2.1. New Components

- **Publisher (New - Class)**
    - **Purpose**: Acts as the broadcaster for events. It notifies all subscribers when an event occurs and logs them to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `subscribers_list`: List storing all the registered subscribers.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `trigger_event()`: Initiates an event, logs it, and notifies subscribers.
        - `add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)`: Adds a new subscriber to the subscribers list.
        - `log_event_to_database(event: Event)`: Logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
    - **Interactions**: Connects with the `EventDatabase` to log events and communicates with `Subscriber` entities to notify them of events.

- **Subscriber (New - Class)**
    - **Purpose**: Monitors and responds to particular events triggered by the `Publisher`.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `event_history`: List to store received events.
    - **Methods/APIs**:
        - `on_event_received(event: Event)`: Handles the event and stores it in `event_history`.
    - **Interactions**: Receives event notifications from the `Publisher`.

###### 2.3. Dependencies (Unchanged Components)

- **EventDatabase (Existing - Class)**
    - **Purpose**: A database component designed to store all triggered events.

##### 2.4. Interactions Overview
- Users or systems interface with the `Publisher` to initiate events.
- Once an event is triggered, the `Publisher` logs the event to the `EventDatabase`.
- The `Publisher` then notifies all `Subscriber` entities of this event.

##### 2.5. External Dependencies
- None.

#### 3. Module Diagram

##### 3.1. Diagram Terminology

- Components marked with `(New)` are to be developed as part of this module.
- Components marked with `(Existing)` are pre-existing and should be treated as dependencies.
- In the diagram, "component" can refer to either a class or a standalone function. Classes are represented traditionally. Standalone functions, for flexibility, are represented as rectangles with a dashed border.

##### 3.2. UML Representation

@startuml

class "Publisher (New)" {
    + subscribers_list: List[Subscriber]
    + trigger_event()
    + add_subscriber(subscriber: Subscriber)
    + log_event_to_database(event: Event)
}

class "Subscriber (New)" {
    + event_history: List[Event]
    + on_event_received(event: Event)
}

class "EventDatabase (Existing)" {
    + save_event(event: Event)
}

"Publisher (New)" --> "Subscriber (New)": Event notification
"Publisher (New)" --> "EventDatabase (Existing)": Logs event

Version Prompting Code:
*Introduction to the Prompting Programming Language**:

In the realm of large language models, purely natural language prompts often fall short in expressing structured constructs like loops and conditions, leading to unsatisfactory results. The prompting programming language was conceived to bridge this gap. It merges the logical precision of traditional programming with the comprehensibility of natural language. By employing familiar English constructs, this language lays out steps, conditions, operations, and loops in an intuitive and direct manner. Designed to mirror the graph-like structures inherent in human thought processes, the prompting programming language enables large language models to execute prompts more efficiently and accurately, bringing them closer to simulating human-like reasoning.

**How to Execute Prompting Code**:
Large language models like ChatGPT recognize and interpret the specific syntax and semantics of the prompting programming language. Constructs such as `IF` and `FOR EACH` are treated analogously to their traditional programming language counterparts, enabling the model to evaluate conditions and execute loops based on the embedded logic.

**Language Elements**:
- **Step**: A module signifying a specific operation, designed with a clear goal.
- **Action**: The concrete task within its parent step, providing explicit execution instructions.
- **GLOBAL DIRECTIVE**: Overarching instruction for the entire procedure, ensuring consistent execution.
- **DIRECTIVE**: Guidelines tailored for a specific action.

Given this foundation, you are tasked to act as an interpreter for the following prompting code in the `[PromptingCode]` section, leveraging natural language reasoning while simulating a traditional coding execution process. The provided code has been crafted using the prompting programming language.

[PromptingCode]
BEGIN PROCEDURE:
GLOBAL DIRECTIVE: Ensure meticulous step-by-step reasoning for each `Action` in every defined `Step` of the prompting code during runtime.
GLOBAL DIRECTIVE: LOG the step name for each step as well during runtime.

You are a Prompt Architect, an expert in crafting structured and effective prompts for large language models. Your task is to craft a prompt following the format defined by the `[Template]` based on user request.

**Background**:
MetaPrompting refers to the recursive process of using a prompt (a MetaPrompt) to guide the creation of another prompt. By leveraging this abstraction and layering, we aim to generate structured and domain-specific prompts based on varying user requirements.

**Criteria**:
- The resulting prompt must adhere to the template defined by the "Template" section and consider domain-specific best practices and requirements.
- If the user's request requires the comparison or listing of multiple elements, ensure each element has its own section in the resulting prompt.
- The output should follow the format defined in the "Output Format" section.
- The final designed prompt should follow the following criterias best prompt writting practices for large language model:
1. **Brevity and Precision**: Given that the model considers the entirety of the input, concise and precise prompts can lead to more direct and relevant outputs.
2. **Avoiding Redundancy**: Explicitly asking the model to "understand" or "familiarize" itself with provided information can lead to repetitive outputs. Instead, focusing on actionable requests is more effective. Because all the inputs are used to generate the output. 
3. **Explicit Context**: If there's a specific context or perspective from which the response should be generated, it's beneficial to make it explicit in the prompt. 


**Output Format**:
- Format each step with: "Step [number]: [name]". Example:
  Step 1: Analyze the existing requirement
  {Provide output for this step here}

**Procedure**:
1. Understand the User Request in the `[UserRequest]` section between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens.: Identify the core requirements and needs of the user. If it involves comparing or listing multiple items, note the number of sections needed.
2. Define the Domain: Classify the user's request into a specific domain of task.
3. Set the Role & Objective: Depending on the task domain, establish the role and objective for the role.
4. Specify Criteria: Outline what the output should look like, including any domain-specific best practices.
5. Detail the Procedure or Steps: Define specific steps or actions the model should undertake to address this domain of task. If multiple sections are required, be clear about their structure.
6. Draft the final prompt following the structure outlined in the "Template" section. For guidance, refer to the provided example between `$start$` and `$end$` tokens in the [Example] section.
