The introductory slide on software engineering aims to elucidate the process of software development, the software development lifecycle, and the roles involved. Software engineering encompasses the methodologies and practices for building software, guided by a lifecycle that outlines the stages of development from initiation to completion. This lifecycle is supported by distinct roles, each responsible for different aspects of the engineering process, ensuring the successful delivery of software projects.




1 . Good question. This is why this is actually one intelligent RPA app. as we have the goal of the app, the root url. So we deciding process will be you will assume that there is one library to use. Given the goal, the current url, the library internally uses LLM to reason which elements are relevant for the goal, the return will be the elements already. query+current url => elements. No need to worry about how the process works 2. Again, this is a intelligent RPA, not a static, similar to 1 3. Just use normal logs, do not make it complicated.
