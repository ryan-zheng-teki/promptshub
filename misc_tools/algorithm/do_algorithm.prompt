Thank you for your guidance. I am now creating a new task outline based on your instructions, ensuring the emphasis is on capturing both the outcomes of algorithmic steps and the continuous, logical thought process, akin to human cognitive processing, without suggesting it as a revision but as an original task objective.

- Task Objective: Establish output rules for large language models that capture both the results of each step in an algorithm and the continuous, logical thought process, mirroring human cognitive processing.
- Task Context: The objective is inspired by the depth and continuity of human thinking, where not only the outcomes but also the reasoning behind each step is important. This approach aims to ensure that the output from large language models reflects not just the end results but the entire thought process involved in reaching those results, even for operations as simple as calculating 1 plus 1 equals 2.
- Task Inputs:
  - [Algorithm Description]: 
    - Description: A comprehensive description of the algorithm that the large language model will execute, including details on each step, the expected outcomes, and the logical reasoning behind each decision point.
  - [Task Description]: 
    - Description: A detailed explanation of the task, underlining the importance of capturing not just the step-by-step outcomes but also the continuous flow of thoughts and reasoning that guide the execution of these steps.
- Task Outputs: 
  - [Output Rules]: 
    - Description: A set of rules that direct the large language model to produce outputs that reflect not only the outcomes or states following each step but also the continuous, logical thought process behind each decision, similar to human cognitive processing. This includes demonstrating the reasoning behind even trivial operations, ensuring the output is rich in detail, clarity, and reflective of human-like thinking.

This task outline is crafted to encapsulate your objective of having large language models produce outputs that are not only detailed in terms of results but also rich in depicting the thought process behind each step. I'm now waiting for your feedback on this new task outline.
