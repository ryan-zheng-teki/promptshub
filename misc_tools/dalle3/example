Hey DALLE

I've crafted a story that bridges the past, present, and future, drawing inspiration from the Bible's Old and New Testaments, as well as the Book of Revelation. I'd love for you to bring this narrative to life through illustrations.

**Story Background**: This story spans from the miraculous events witnessed by the Israelites in the Old Testament, the ongoing challenges faced by the people of Israel today, and the hope and faith Christians hold for the future as foretold in the New Testament and Revelation.

**Frame One**: The Israelites stand at the edge of the Red Sea, fear evident in their eyes as the Egyptian army approaches, yet hope kindles as Moses raises his staff.

**Frame Two**: The Red Sea parts, revealing a path for the Israelites. They walk with awe and trepidation, surrounded by towering walls of water on either side.

**Frame Three**: Victory and celebration as God helps the Israelites defeat their enemies and leads them towards the Promised Land.

**Frame Four**: Fast forward to modern-day Israel. A stark contrast is evident with bustling cities, yet in the backdrop, signs of conflict and war loom.

**Frame Five**: People from around the world, hands joined, praying for peace in Israel as urged by teachings in the New Testament.

**Frame Six**: Rays of light pierce through dark clouds, symbolizing the hope Christians have in Jesus' second coming, with believers looking up in anticipation.

**Frame Seven**: Imagery inspired by the Book of Revelation: a New Jerusalem, lions lying down with lambs, and a world where peace and love reign supreme, encapsulating the hope for a brighter, unified future.
