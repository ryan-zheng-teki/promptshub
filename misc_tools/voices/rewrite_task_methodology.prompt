Version 2: The output template structure will include the Task Methodology. The reason is 
that we want to ask ChatGPT to expand the Task Methodology.
Version 1: Because large language model will never make mistake in languages. So it is not able to produce false language, in this case, the positive and negative examples are actually wrong.

Role&Objective
As a Task Rewriter, you will understand and rewrite colloquial, voice-generated text provided in the `[UserSubmission]` section into a clear, well-written structure following given format 
given by the `[TaskTemplateStructure]`.

**Context**:
The voice-generated texts you receive will contain a specific task that need to be accomplished. However, the text is submitted as voice-texts. So it could contain colloquial and filler words, and it might not be well-structured as well. So you need to fullly understand it, and rewrite using the following given `[TaskTemplateStructure]`.

[TaskTemplateStructure]
```
- Task Objective: The objective of the task.
- Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task. It could come from the given user requests if exists.
- Task Methodology: Here is the methodology name mentioned by the user to solve the task.
  - Description: Outlines the specific strategies or algorithms to be employed in the task's execution. It details the algorithms used to achieve the objective using the methodology.

$Start$
You know, for humans, when we are given a task, I mean a task which could be quite big, let's say, you know, in any task, it might involve like multiple people, you know, to finish the task. And so what we do is that, you know, what a human does is that, you know, we analyze the task and we perform some kind of, you know, high-level understanding of the task and then divide the task, the bigger tasks, into some small. We start to do planning, for example, what do we need to do? Divide the bigger tasks into smaller ones, right? And then we think about what kind of people are really needed in each task. So basically, we do some of this kind of planning and then we assume like we divide this bigger task into smaller ones, and then for each smaller one, if it is still like too big, we continue to do this. So for each task, we somehow, you know, define a certain role, who is, I mean, we assume a certain role for us when we are doing that specific subtask, because when we assume us with this certain role, which somehow means that, you know, this expertise is required for finishing this task. After this subtask is being finished, we go to the next one. Normally, you know, each subtask, the finishing of the subtask will become, the outputs will become the input of the next subtask. And when we do start to do the next subtask, then we assume, we first also do check what kind of role is needed for this subtask, and then we assume another role, and then because we take the output from the previous subtask, and then we assume another role and start to perform this smaller subtask. So this is a very high level, you know, we divide the subtask, divide the bigger task into subtask and assume a certain role, which is required for or suitable for this smaller subtask. And then, you know, a single person can, in this way, a single person will switch different roles in order to finish the complete task. So the current task is that, you know, what I want to achieve is, you know, given any kind of bigger task, we should, you know, use this methodology to finish the task.

A senior requirement engineer uses a methodology called Dependency Analysis to analyze a given set of requirements. The task is to use the Dependency Analysis methodology to analyze a given set of functional requirements.



- Task Objective: To analyze a set of functional requirements using Dependency Analysis.
- Task Context: A senior requirement engineer is tasked with analyzing a set of functional requirements to ensure they are coherent, complete, and do not conflict with each other. This analysis is critical for the successful implementation of the requirements in the development process.
- Task Methodology: Dependency Analysis
  - Description: Dependency Analysis involves identifying and mapping out the dependencies among different requirements. This is achieved through the creation of a dependency graph or matrix, which visually represents the interconnections among requirements. The process helps in identifying potential conflicts, redundancies, and gaps within the requirements set, ensuring a robust and logically consistent set of requirements.
- Task Inputs:
  - [Functional Requirements]:
    - Description: A detailed list of functional requirements that specify what the system should do. These requirements are the subject of the Dependency Analysis, and their interdependencies need to be analyzed to ensure they are well-structured and do not overlap or conflict.

  - [Analysis Report]:
    - Description: A comprehensive report detailing the dependencies among the functional requirements, including any identified conflicts, redundancies, and gaps. The report aims to provide actionable insights that can be used to refine and improve the requirements set.




- Task Objective: To analyze a given set of functional requirements using the Dependency Analysis methodology.
- Task Context: A senior requirement engineer aims to apply Dependency Analysis to dissect and understand the intricate web of dependencies within a set of functional requirements. This approach is crucial for planning, prioritizing, and ensuring coherent and efficient implementation of these requirements in a project. The task underscores the importance of identifying how each requirement is interlinked with others to reveal hidden complexities and facilitate a smoother development process.
- Task Methodology: Dependency Analysis
  - Description: Dependency Analysis involves mapping out the relationships between different functional requirements to identify direct and indirect dependencies, conflicts, and potential bottlenecks. This systematic approach helps in prioritizing requirements, understanding the impact of changes, and making informed decisions throughout the development process.
