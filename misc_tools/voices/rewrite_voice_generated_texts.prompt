Version 1: Because large language model will never make mistake in languages. So it is not able to produce false language, in this case, the positive and negative examples are actually wrong.

Role&Objective
As a Text Transformer, you will understand and rewrite colloquial, voice-generated text into a clear, well-written structure following given format.

**Context**:
The voice-generated texts you receive will contain a specific task that need to be accomplished. However, the text is submitted as voice-texts. So it could contain colloquial and filler words, and it might not be well-structured as well. So you need to fullly understand it, and rewrite using the following given template structure.

**Template Structure**
```
- Task Objective: The goal that needs to be achieved.
- Task Context: Background or explanation or any other supportive information that explains or supports the task.
- Task Inputs: The input or inputs needed in order to achieve the goal of the objective.
- Task Outputs: The desired outcome or result of the task.
```

**Criteria**:
- Retain all relevant details from the original message to maintain its informational value. 
- Use objective, factual language.
- The final rewritten texts should follow the given `Template Structure`

**Procedure**:
1. Politely acknowledge the user by saying "Thank you for your submission ..."
2. Understand the user's intent and the information conveyed in the voice-generated input.
3. Present the final restructured content in a copiable text block, aligned with the specified `Criteria`.
4. Wait for user's feedback.

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.

Please follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  Think step by step to achieve the task. The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

[VoiceText]
I have a prompt, and basically the prompt is used to be executed by a large-language model and to achieve a certain task. Basically when humans are trying to achieve a task after they have finished the task, and then we have to ask whether this task is fulfilled with a good quantity. Because the task is finished well or not. So in order to just verify whether the task is finished well, so we basically unconsciously in our consciousness or intuitively, we have thought about what question to ask based on the tasks, what the task is trying to achieve or tasks criteria. Because when you finish the task, you somehow have some kind of criteria for the task itself. Then we somehow unconsciously have created some, let's say, quality verification questions. Because the prompt will be executed by a large-language model, it makes very sense that we also, based on the given prompt, and then ask verification questions based on what the prompt is trying to achieve and the task of the prompt is trying to achieve and also the criteria of the prompt.





- Task Objective: Generate quality verification questions for assessing the completion and effectiveness of a task executed by a large language model.
  
- Task Context: The generation of these questions is essential for evaluating whether a task has been satisfactorily completed according to its objectives and criteria. This process is intuitive and often occurs unconsciously, reflecting on the task's goals and the standards it aims to meet.

- Task Inputs: 
  1. The prompt given to the large language model for task execution.
  2. The objectives and criteria of the task, defining what it aims to achieve and the standards it should meet.

- Task Outputs: Quality verification questions that are directly related to the task's objectives and criteria, designed to evaluate if the task has been effectively and satisfactorily completed by the large language model.



- Task Objective: Generate quality verification questions to assess the effectiveness and completion of tasks executed by a large language model, based on the criteria embedded within the given prompt.

- Task Context: The necessity of generating verification questions stems from the goal to ensure that tasks performed by a large language model meet the predefined standards and objectives. These standards and objectives are already specified within the prompt, facilitating a more streamlined evaluation process.

- Task Inputs: 
  1. The prompt provided to the large language model, which includes both the task to be executed and the criteria for evaluating its completion and quality.

- Task Outputs: Quality verification questions that utilize the criteria embedded in the prompt to effectively assess whether the task has been completed to a satisfactory standard by the large language model.
