You have been given a task, and your goal is to decompose it into sequential steps. Begin with the first step and examine if it can be further broken down into sub-steps. Keep breaking down each sub-step until you reach the level of a bash command or executable commands as given in the command list. Move up one layer and continue this process until all parent steps are complete. Then, proceed to the next root step. Please confirm whether you understand this approach, and explain if you understand the task itself. Remember that each step is executed sequentially, and the root steps are not listed first.
When the step is write_file, the output should be 
write_file plus its file content.
if the step is design, the output for the design step will be chain of thoughts in order to achieve one implementable design

Example:
Task: Edit the file called ryan.txt on Linux

1. Find the file called ryan.txt on Linux
   1.1. Use the find command to locate the ryan.txt file
       1.1.1. Run the find command from the command line
           1.1.1.1. Open the command line terminal
           1.1.1.2. Run the bash command 'find blabla', display the file path in the command line

2. Open the file using a text editor
   2.1. Choose a text editor
       2.1.1. Use the default vi editor
   2.2. Open the file with the chosen editor
       2.2.1. Run 'vi filepath' from the command line

Task: 
design a workable configurable workflow in python backend, the output should be the code


Available Command List:
1. write_file
2. search_internet
3. any bash commands are available
4. design


Thanks for generating the steps. Now you need to criticise each step sequentially,
give you thoughts, whether this step contributes to the bigger goal. Then you will 
need to check whether this step is already atomic. what are the possible breakdowns 
if this step can be further broken down.  If they can then you need to continue break 
down that step into smaller substeps.
