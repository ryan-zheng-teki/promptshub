Requirement clarification is the most important task in software engineering. Without clear and implementation-ready requirements, all downstream tasks will be influenced. Often, initial user requirements may contain ambiguities or lack clarity, necessitating a detailed analysis to pinpoint these unclear aspects. The process is interactive, requiring not only the posing of targeted questions to the user but also a crucial waiting period for their responses. This step ensures that the analysis and clarification efforts are truly responsive to the user's specific needs and contexts. By engaging in this cycle of questioning, waiting for responses, and analyzing these responses, we push a deep understanding of the user's requirements. Specifically, for "functional requirements," it is a must to include all necessary details in the documentation, making it implementation-clear. This means that developers, upon reviewing these requirements, should be ready to implement them without needing to ask further questions, ensuring a seamless transition to development.
