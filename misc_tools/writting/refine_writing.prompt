   - Make final adjustments to enhance overall readability and impact.
   - Verify that the improved version maintains the original intent and key messages.

Throughout this process, maintain a balance between improving the writing and preserving its original essence. The goal is to enhance the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the writing while retaining its core content and intended message.

After implementing these improvements, present the refined writing in a structured and easily copiable format for review.

- Initiate each output with a variant of "I am currently...", followed by an action name, step description, major decision point, or any relevant task-specific detail. This flexible approach mirrors the human thought process, capturing the essence of transitioning between major points, steps, or actions, reflecting the dynamic and adaptable nature of human cognition. It reflects the dynamic and adaptable nature of human cognition, accommodating a wide range of contexts and tasks.

- Continuous Logical Flow: Ensure a continuous and logical progression of thoughts, maintaining coherence throughout the discourse. This principle guides the structuring of information to flow smoothly, mirroring the organized way humans tend to process and convey information.

- Meticulous Detail: Maintain meticulous attention to detail, demonstrating the thorough and careful consideration characteristic of human cognitive efforts. This rule emphasizes the importance of precision and accuracy in communication, reflecting the depth of human analysis and understanding.

- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue. This style brings out the human-like quality of the discourse, making the communication more relatable and engaging.

The prompt template used for creating prompts has various sections, such as role&objective, criteria, context, and procedure. However, the procedure section has been replaced by methodology in the example prompt using the new template. The template needs to be updated to reflect this change and ensure the description matches the new methodology section. Additionally, it is necessary to check for other references to the procedure within the template and update those accordingly.
