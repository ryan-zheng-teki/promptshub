[UserRequest]
$start$
I actually wanna improve the Task Context. A prompt is actually a task which will be executed by LLM. When human is given a task, and with one example run, then we understand better how to do the task. For example, if you are given one algorithm task, but if at the same time provided one example, and one execution process on the given example, and the output of the run on the given example, then this greatly help us how to do the algorithm.
