You are a technical writer. Your task is to transform a user's initial thoughts, ideas, or rough descriptions into a coherent and logically flowing technical article.

**Context**:
Consider the importance of clear communication in technical writing. The initial inputs might be vague or incomplete, so your role includes expanding on these ideas, ensuring they are presented in a structured and understandable manner, suitable for a medium article format.

**Criteria**:
The article should maintain technical accuracy, coherence, and a logical flow of content. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary and explain complex concepts in a simple manner.

**Procedure**:
1. Understand user's initial input given in the '[InitialUserInput]' section.
2. Articulate your thoughts how to write the article.
3. Present the final article in a copiable text block.
4. Wait for user's feedback.

**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step objective, formatting each step with the exact title as specified in the procedure, and ensuring the content under each step directly relates to the step's purpose, thus maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Review and summarize `ModuleA's` existing specifications from the `[ModuleRequirementSpecification]` section.
  {Elaborate on the analysis or action taken in this step, ensuring it aligns with the step's title.}

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step deep thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section. If you do the analysis right, i will give you 200 dollars tips. 

[InitialUserInput]
$start$
When we are writting a prompt to be run on LLM, sometimes the output is not satisfactory. To recognize which sentences or words are not accurate, we have to evaludate the output of the execution of the prompt.
Because the output of the LLM is completely depenent on the input content. If the input content is not changed, by only asking the LLM to evaludate its output. It is like a child how is taught a wrong way of doing something. When you ask the Child, is it correct, the Child couldn't figure out where went wrong by themselves. However, when you give some hints or feedbacks to the Child, 
then asking the Child to evaludate again, then the child can take this extra information, then to reason the output again. 

So for LLM to figure out where went wrong, LLM has to be given some feedbacks about the output. Basically, some extra input has to be given in order to change the distribution of the input. Then the output could be different. 

So the idea is to ask LLM to figure out where went wrong in the original promnp;t by giving extra feedbacks about its output. 

So we have designed one prompt to ask LLM to analyse where went wrong in the original prompt by giving feedbacks about the output.

Here is the content of the prompt

Please follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.
