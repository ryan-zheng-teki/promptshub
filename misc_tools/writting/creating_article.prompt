[InitialUserInput]
$start$
When we are writting a prompt to be run on LLM, sometimes the output is not satisfactory. To recognize which sentences or words are not accurate, we have to evaludate the output of the execution of the prompt.
Because the output of the LLM is completely depenent on the input content. If the input content is not changed, by only asking the LLM to evaludate its output. It is like a child how is taught a wrong way of doing something. When you ask the Child, is it correct, the Child couldn't figure out where went wrong by themselves. However, when you give some hints or feedbacks to the Child, 
then asking the Child to evaludate again, then the child can take this extra information, then to reason the output again. 

So for LLM to figure out where went wrong, LLM has to be given some feedbacks about the output. Basically, some extra input has to be given in order to change the distribution of the input. Then the output could be different. 

So the idea is to ask LLM to figure out where went wrong in the original promnp;t by giving extra feedbacks about its output. 

So we have designed one prompt to ask LLM to analyse where went wrong in the original prompt by giving feedbacks about the output.

Here is the content of the prompt

Title: Implementing Cursor-Based Pagination with Strawberry GraphQL and SQLAlchemy

Introduction:
In this article, we will explore how to implement cursor-based pagination in a GraphQL API using Strawberry GraphQL and SQLAlchemy. Pagination is a crucial aspect of API design, especially when dealing with large datasets. Cursor-based pagination provides an efficient and reliable way to retrieve a subset of results, allowing clients to navigate through the data in a scalable manner.

Understanding Cursor-Based Pagination:
Cursor-based pagination relies on a unique identifier (cursor) to determine the starting point for the next set of results. Instead of using page numbers, the server returns a limited number of results along with a cursor that points to the next page of data. This approach ensures consistent and reliable pagination, even when the dataset is large or frequently changing.

Strawberry GraphQL:
Strawberry is a Python library for building GraphQL APIs. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define GraphQL schemas using Python classes and functions. With Strawberry, you can define your GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions using familiar Python syntax. It leverages Python's type hints for type safety and provides decorators to define resolvers for your GraphQL fields.

Relay-style Pagination in Strawberry GraphQL:
Strawberry GraphQL provides support for Relay-style pagination, which is a specification for implementing efficient pagination in GraphQL APIs. Relay-style pagination defines a standard way to structure connections and edges in the GraphQL schema, allowing clients to query paginated results using a cursor-based approach.

In the provided code, the `relay` module from Strawberry GraphQL is used to define the connection types and implement pagination. The `@relay.connection` decorator is used to specify the connection type for the paginated query, and the `ListConnection` class is used to define the structure of the paginated results.

SQLAlchemy:
SQLAlchemy is a popular Python library for working with relational databases. It provides a set of tools for defining database models, querying data, and performing database operations. With SQLAlchemy, you can define your database models using Python classes and use an object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with the database. It offers a powerful query API for expressing complex database queries using Python code.

Implementing Cursor-Based Pagination:
To implement cursor-based pagination in a GraphQL API using Strawberry GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, follow these steps:

1. Define your database models using SQLAlchemy. Create a `BookModel` class that represents the structure of the book table in the database.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class BookModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "books"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
    author = Column(String)
```

2. Create a base repository class (`BaseRepository`) that provides basic database operations and a `get_all_lazy` method that returns a `LazyQuery` object.

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from sqlalchemy.orm import Query, Session

ModelType = TypeVar("ModelType")

class LazyQuery(Generic[ModelType]):
    def __init__(self, query: Query):
        self.query: Query = query

    def __getitem__(self, key: slice) -> Query:
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            return self.query.slice(key.start, key.stop)
        raise TypeError("LazyQuery only supports slicing.")

class BaseRepository(Generic[ModelType]):
    model = None

    @property
    def db(self) -> Session:
        return request_scoped_db_session.get()

    def lazy_query(self, *criterion) -> LazyQuery[ModelType]:
        query: Query = self.db.query(self.model)
        if criterion:
            query = query.filter(*criterion)
        return LazyQuery(query)

    def get_all_lazy(self) -> LazyQuery[ModelType]:
        return self.lazy_query()
```

3. Define a converter function (`model_to_book_graphql`) that converts a `BookModel` instance to a `book` GraphQL type.

```python
from src.api.grapqhl.types.book_types import book

def model_to_book_graphql(book_model: BookModel) -> book:
    return book(
        id=strawberry.ID(str(book_model.id)),
        title=book_model.title,
        author=book_model.author,
    )
```

4. Define your GraphQL schema using Strawberry GraphQL. Create types for your data objects (e.g., `book` and `bookInput`) and a connection type (`bookListConnection`) that represents the paginated results.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay

@strawberry.type
class book:
    id: strawberry.ID
    title: str
    author: str

@strawberry.input
class bookInput:
    title: str
    author: str

@strawberry.type
class bookListConnection(relay.ListConnection[book]):
    @classmethod
    def resolve_node(cls, node: BookModel, *, info: Info, **kwargs) -> book:
        return model_to_book_graphql(node)
```

5. Implement a resolver function for the paginated query (e.g., `get_all_books`). This function should use the `LazyQuery` object to retrieve the data from the database and return it as a Relay connection.

```python
from typing import Iterable
from strawberry.types import Info
from src.api.grapqhl.converters.book_converters import model_to_book_graphql
from src.db.repositories.book_repository import bookRepository

book_repository = bookRepository()

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @relay.connection(bookListConnection)
    def get_all_books(self, info) -> Iterable[book]:
        books = book_repository.get_all_lazy()
        return books
```

6. Use the `@relay.connection` decorator to specify the connection type for the paginated query. This decorator handles the pagination arguments and returns the data in the format expected by Relay-style pagination.

7. In the resolver function, call the `get_all_lazy` method from the base repository to obtain a `LazyQuery` object representing the query to fetch all data from the database.

8. The `ListConnection` class from Strawberry GraphQL takes care of slicing the `LazyQuery` object based on the pagination arguments provided by the client.

9. The sliced `LazyQuery` is executed, and the corresponding subset of data is retrieved from the database using SQLAlchemy.

10. The retrieved `BookModel` instances are converted to the appropriate GraphQL types using the `model_to_book_graphql` function in the `resolve_node` method of the connection class.

11. The paginated results are returned to the client, along with the necessary pagination information (e.g., `edges`, `pageInfo`) as defined by Relay-style pagination.

Conclusion:
Implementing cursor-based pagination in a GraphQL API using Strawberry GraphQL and SQLAlchemy provides a powerful and efficient way to handle large datasets. By leveraging the strengths of each technology, you can create a scalable and performant API that allows clients to retrieve paginated results seamlessly.

Strawberry GraphQL simplifies the process of defining the GraphQL schema and resolvers while providing support for Relay-style pagination. SQLAlchemy offers a robust ORM for interacting with the database and performing efficient queries.
