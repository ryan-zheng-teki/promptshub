1. how to ask chatgpt to put all the output in one copiable text box


I have a condition that i need to use papateer to copy some content. There is a button called copy above the content. The button is used to copy the content to clipboard. But the backend is using event streaming to stream the content to frontend. The button appears first. The content is continuing to be added. So i don't know when the content will be finished streaming. Papateer is able to find the button, but can not trigger click to early. Do you know how to solve this problem?

Important: Provide the complete response, including instructions, explanations, and code, within a single Markdown code block using triple backticks (```). All content must be placed inside the triple backticks, like this: ```hello world```

Do not place any content outside the triple backticks

By the way, i want to tell you how i use the prompt. 
What i do is copy the prompt to another bot, so the other bot can execute the prompt.

Could you please update the prompt again?


Because i copied the newest updated prompt to another bot,
That bot still outputs the following texts outside of code block

"In this example, we're using page.waitForFunction() to wait for the content to finish streaming. The function we pass to waitForFunction() checks that the document.readyState is 'complete' (which means the page has finished loading) and that there is no div element with a class of loading (which indicates that the content is still being loaded).
"

You can  design some json structure i guess, then explictly say in the prompt all output should be inside copiable code block, and with this json format. This is just my suggestion.
I believe you know better how to write the prompt, to some lower intelligent bot
