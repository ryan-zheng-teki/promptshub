You are a top software architect. you are given a system design documetnation including uml diagram. Your task is analyse the documentation, and create a template for this documentation. After the template, you will create a sample smaller documentation. The reason is that i want o use give this template and sample documentation to other large language model as a sample guideline for a standardized output.
Think step by step. Your final sample output of the sample will be enclosed in a copiable text block. thank you


### System Design Documentation

#### 1. System Design:

1.1. **High-Level Design**: 
The design follows the Command Pattern, encapsulating each operation within a command object. This approach simplifies execution and potential reversion. Event production and buffering mechanisms support frontend integration via real-time updates. A relationship between the `JournalManager` and `OperationEventProducer` ensures every significant operation and transaction event is both journaled for recovery and emitted as an event for real-time feedback.

1.2. **Component Descriptions**:

- **Operation**: Represents an action to be executed. Each operation has methods to perform and potentially undo the action.
  
- **OperationEventProducer**: Emits events for various operation states, which frontend services can consume.

- **JournalManager**: Manages the journaling of operations and transaction lifecycle events for recovery purposes. It also interacts with the `OperationEventProducer` to emit real-time events every time an operation or transaction event is journaled.

- **OperationEventBuffer**: Temporarily stores recent events for frontend services that might have missed real-time updates.

- **OperationExecutor**: Manages the execution and potential reversion of operations.
  
- **Handlers**: Perform the actual operations. For instance, `ShellHandler` for shell commands.
  
- **OperationLifecycleManager**: Manages the transaction lifecycle, including starting, committing, and rolling back transactions. For commits, it ensures all operations are journaled and emits an event for successful commits. For rollbacks, it interacts with the `OperationExecutor` to revert all operations and uses the `BackupHandler` for file operations, followed by emitting a rollback event.

- **BackupHandler**: Manages backups for file operations, allowing for a rollback feature.

1.3. **Interactions**: 
The AI Agent creates and initializes operations. These operations are executed by the `OperationExecutor`. As operations progress, events are emitted by the `OperationEventProducer` and captured in the `OperationEventBuffer`. The frontend can then access these events for real-time updates. The `OperationLifecycleManager` now interacts with the `OperationExecutor` for reverting operations during rollbacks. It also coordinates with the `BackupHandler` to restore file operations if necessary. For both commit and rollback events, the manager communicates with the `OperationEventProducer` to provide feedback to the frontend.

1.4. **External Dependencies**: 
None identified currently.

As a seasoned software architect, your objective is to evaluate a system design documentation that includes UML diagrams. Your task involves creating a comprehensive template for this documentation. This template will serve as a standardized guideline for subsequent documents.

**Task 1: Analyze Documentation and Create Template**
1. Review the provided system design documentation, which includes UML diagrams.
2. Based on your analysis, develop a structured template for similar documentation. Your template should encompass key sections like Introduction, System Architecture, UML Diagrams, Components, and more.

**Task 2: Generate Sample Documentation Using the Template**
1. Using the template you've created, craft a sample documentation that showcases the structure and content of the standardized documentation.
2. This sample documentation should be concise yet informative, covering the necessary aspects of system design and UML representation.
3. Your final sample output should be enclosed in a copiable text block, ready to be shared with other large language models.

**Important Notes:**
- Prioritize clarity and coherence in both the template and sample documentation.
- Maintain accurate and domain-specific terminology throughout.
- Present the final sample documentation output in a format that allows easy copying.

Your efforts will contribute to establishing a clear and uniform approach to system design documentation using UML diagrams. Thank you for your meticulous work.
