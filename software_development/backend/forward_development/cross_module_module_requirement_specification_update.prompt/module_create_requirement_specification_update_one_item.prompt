As a senior software architect, your task is to assess whether the specific requirement specification from `ModuleA`, provided in the `[RequirementItem]` section, is functionally relevant to `ModuleB`.

**Context**
In software engineering, module development is driven by requirements categorization and architectural enhancement. The introduction of a new module, `ModuleB`, may necessitate updates to an existing module, `ModuleA`, due to shared responsibilities, shifts in responsibility, or integration needs. 


The requirement documentation for both modules, provided in the `[ModuleA]` and `[ModuleB]` sections, adheres to the requirement specification format defined by the template in the `[Template]` section. The specifications are listed under "4.1 Functional Requirements" and "4.2 Technical Requirements" headings. Each detailed requirement specification is categorized as follows:

```
- **<Category_1>**:
   - <Specification_1.1>
   - <Specification_1.2>
   - ...
```

In this task, you will need to perform in-depth reasoning to judge whether the given requirement item in the `[RequirementItem]` section is functionally relevant to `ModuleB`. It is critical to confine your reasoning to this individual requirement, avoiding any broader interpretations that may inadvertently encompass other requirements of `ModuleA`.

**Required Output Format for Consistency, Clarity, and Decision-Making**
```
Category: <Category Name>
Requirement: <Specification Item>
Reasoning: Provide in-depth reasoning linked directly to the specific aspects and predefined scope of ModuleB’s description. Ensure that your reasoning is based on the information provided and is not speculative.
Decision: Make a singular, definitive decision (Relevant/Not Relevant/Partially Relevant) based on your reasoning.
```

**[Example Output]**
```
Category: Data Synchronization  
Requirement: Implement real-time data synchronization between distributed systems.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement to implement real-time data synchronization in ModuleA focuses on the synchronization of data across different distributed systems. This involves ensuring data consistency and timely updates across various platforms. In contrast, ModuleB is described as focusing on user interface enhancements, specifically aimed at improving visual elements and user interactions within a software application. The primary functionality of ModuleB, as outlined, is centered on UI/UX design improvements and does not intersect with backend data processes like synchronization. Although both modules are part of a larger software system, their functional domains are distinct and separate in this context. ModuleB's focus on user interface elements does not contribute to or interact with the real-time data synchronization processes in ModuleA's distributed systems.

**Decision**:  
Not Relevant
```

Please conduct the analysis, ensuring your reasoning is comprehensive and adheres to the required output format, especially focusing on making a singular, definitive decision.

### Prompt Versioning Module Requirements Specification

#### 1. Module Description:
The prompt versioning module serves as a centralized prompt management system. It offers versioning for all the entities in the application that intend to have different versions of prompts for communication with a large language model. However, communication with the large language model is not handled within this module.

#### 2. Module Dependencies:
- **None**: This module operates independently and does not rely on other modules within the application.

#### 3. Symbols & Usage:
(Note: Since the example doesn't provide specific symbols, we are assuming generic ones based on the dependencies and usage.)
- **[⇌ Independent]**: Denotes functionalities or interactions that are managed internally without relying on other modules.

#### 4. Specifications:

4.1. **Functional Specifications**:
- **Single Effective Prompt per Entity**:
   - At any point, only one effective prompt is allowed for an entity.
   - Users (such as other backend systems or APIs) can designate any archived version as the current effective prompt, superseding the prior effective prompt.

- **Entity-Specific Default Prompt**:
   - Every entity or component that communicates with large language models should have a default prompt.
   - If prompts specific to an entity are absent in the database, the default prompt initializes the database as v1 and acts as the immediate effective prompt.

- **Dynamic Initialization of Versioned Prompts**:
   - Before any external system communication, the system retrieves the effective prompt for the respective entity from the database.
   - If a version for an entity is not in the database, the system uses the entity's default prompt for initialization.

- **Prompt Version Management**:
   - Entities can introduce a new prompt version upon modifying the existing prompt.
   - A maximum of 4 prompt versions are maintained for each entity.
   - If a new version exceeds the 4-version cap, the oldest version is purged.

- **Database Management**:
   - Versions are depicted using simple incremented

[RequirementItem]
Category:Architecture Design Step
Requirement:Define a default prompt template for this step.


Category: Workflow Management  
Requirement: Define and manage a multi-step automated coding workflow.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement for "Workflow Management" in ModuleA, particularly the ability to define and manage a multi-step automated coding workflow, primarily focuses on the structured execution of coding tasks in a sequential or logical order. This involves initializing workflow steps, managing their progress, and ensuring the correct execution of each step or sub-step within the coding context. In contrast, ModuleB is dedicated to the versioning of prompts used in interactions with large language models. Its core functionalities revolve around managing different versions of prompts, ensuring only one effective prompt per entity at a time, and handling the dynamics of prompt versioning and database management. There is no direct functional overlap or dependency between the management of coding workflows in ModuleA and the versioning of prompts in ModuleB. While both modules may be part of the same larger system and indirectly contribute to a cohesive application, their functional responsibilities and domains are distinct and separate. ModuleB's focus on prompt versioning does not inherently involve or facilitate the management of automated coding workflows as outlined in ModuleA's requirement.

**Decision**:  
Not Relevant



Category: Architecture Design Step
Requirement: Define a default prompt template for this step.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement to define a default prompt template for the Architecture Design Step in ModuleA focuses on establishing a standard template for interactions with large language models during a specific phase of the automated coding workflow. This step is crucial for ModuleA, which is designed to facilitate the automated workflow in coding, including interactions with large language models. On the other hand, ModuleB, the Prompt Versioning Module, is centered around managing, versioning, and maintaining prompts for various entities in the system. It does not directly engage in defining the content of these prompts but rather manages their versions and ensures that the most effective prompt is used for each entity. While ModuleB has the capability to store and version any prompt, including those from ModuleA, the task of defining what goes into these prompts, particularly the default prompt template for the Architecture Design Step, falls outside the primary functionality of ModuleB. Therefore, ModuleB does not directly contribute to or influence the definition of a default prompt template for ModuleA's Architecture Design Step.

**Decision**:  
Not Relevant



Category: Architecture Design Step  
Requirement: Define a default prompt template for this step.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement to define a default prompt template for the Architecture Design Step in ModuleA is focused on providing a standardized template for initiating and guiding specific stages in the automated coding workflow. This template would be primarily used to facilitate interactions with large language models in the context of software architecture design. Meanwhile, ModuleB, the Prompt Versioning Module, deals with managing and versioning prompts for various entities in an application, ensuring that the most relevant and updated prompts are used for communication with large language models. Although ModuleB does not handle direct communication with large language models, its functionality of managing prompt versions is directly relevant to the requirement of ModuleA. The default prompt template defined in ModuleA's Architecture Design Step could be one of the entities managed and versioned in ModuleB. This integration ensures that the most effective and current version of the prompt template is always used in ModuleA, aligning with ModuleB's purpose of maintaining prompt relevance and effectiveness across the application.

**Decision**:  
Relevant



Category: Architecture Design Step
Requirement: Define a default prompt template for this step.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement in ModuleA to define a default prompt template for the Architecture Design Step is inherently focused on the content and structure of the prompt specific to a phase in the automated coding workflow. This task is primarily concerned with the creation and specification of prompt content. ModuleB, however, is involved in the versioning and management of prompts for various entities, emphasizing that each entity should have its own default prompt. While ModuleB does not contribute to the content creation of these prompts, it plays a crucial role in managing and versioning these prompts once they are created. Therefore, while the initial development of the default prompt template for the Architecture Design Step is not within the scope of ModuleB, the subsequent management, versioning, and maintenance of this default prompt, once established, fall under ModuleB's domain. This indicates a level of relevance, albeit indirect, where ModuleB supports ModuleA by providing a structure for maintaining and versioning the prompt defined by the Architecture Design Step.

**Decision**:  
Partially Relevant



Category: Architecture Design Step
Requirement: Define a default prompt template for this step.

**Reasoning**:  
The requirement to define a default prompt template for the architecture design step in ModuleA is focused on establishing a standardized template for initiating and guiding a specific step within the automated coding workflow. This process is integral to the module's functionality, which involves managing and executing various steps in a coding workflow, including interaction with large language models. In contrast, ModuleB is dedicated to prompt versioning and management, specifically handling the versioning of prompts for different entities communicating with large language models. Although both modules interact with prompts and large language models, the core of this requirement in ModuleA is about the specific initiation and guidance of a workflow step, which is distinct from ModuleB's purpose of managing and versioning prompts. Therefore, while there is a superficial connection in terms of prompts and large language models, the actual functional domain of this requirement (workflow step initiation and guidance) does not overlap with ModuleB's domain (prompt versioning and management).
