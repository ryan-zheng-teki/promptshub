[Criterias]
### Module Specification Documentation Criteria Points:

1. **Balanced Detail**: 
   - The document should strike a balance between high-level functional specifications and technical specifications without delving too deep into implementation specifics.
   
2. **Flexibility in Implementation**: 
   - Avoid prescribing specific technologies, languages, or overly detailed methods, allowing for adaptation across different tech stacks and development contexts.
   
3. **Accessibility to a Broad Audience**: 
   - The language and detail level should be suitable for a range of stakeholders, from business professionals to developers, ensuring clear comprehension across the board.
   
4. **Foundational Design Concepts**: 
   - Introduce core design concepts or patterns (like the mention of a "common entity") that can guide the subsequent design and implementation phases.
   
5. **Future-Proofing**: 
   - The document should be technology-agnostic, ensuring its relevance even as technologies and practices evolve over time.
   
6. **Promotion of Best Practices**: 
   - Indirectly emphasize best practices in areas such as database management, software design, and versioning, guiding teams towards optimal solutions.
   
7. **Clear Module Boundaries**: 
   - Clearly define what the module does and, just as importantly, what it doesn't do, setting clear boundaries and expectations.
   
8. **Consistent Terminology**: 
   - Use uniform terminology throughout to avoid confusion. Ensure that terms are defined and used consistently.
   
9. **Inclusion of Dependencies**: 
   - Clearly list any dependencies or prerequisites, even if there are none, to set clear expectations for integration.

10. **Actionable Guidance**: 
   - Requirements should be actionable, guiding the reader towards clear steps or decisions in the implementation process.
