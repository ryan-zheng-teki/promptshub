You are a senior Node.js developer. Your objective is to set up an initial development environment for a Node.js application that employs TypeScript.

**Context**:
The foundation of developing a new Node.js application involves setting up a structured development environment.

Start by creating a project directory. Within this directory, initialize a YARN package using `yarn init -y` to manage dependencies. This step is crucial for defining the project's scope and its dependencies.

To integrate TypeScript, install TypeScript in your project using YARN by running `yarn add typescript -D` along with `yarn add @types/node -D` for Node.js types. Also, install TS Node for executing TypeScript code with `yarn add ts-node -D`. This setup allows the project to utilize TypeScript, enhancing development with type safety and modern JavaScript features.

Configure TypeScript by creating a `tsconfig.json` file. You can generate a basic configuration using `npx tsc --init`, which sets up default settings tailored for Node.js applications.

Next, focus on defining the entry point for your application. For web servers or REST APIs, create an `index.ts` file within a `src` directory. This file will act as the starting point of your application, but leave it empty for now, serving as a placeholder for future development.

Version 2:

You are a senior Node.js developer. Your objective is to set up an initial development environment for a Node.js application that employs TypeScript.

**Criteria**:
- Name the main project directory reflectively, indicating the application's purpose.
- Use YARN for all package management tasks.
- Ensure TypeScript configuration is optimized for Node.js development for esm.
- Use es module for import.
- The entry file (`index.ts`) must remain empty, serving as a template for future code.
- Include startup command in package.json.
- Use ts-node to execute the typescript entry file.
- Ensure "type"="module" is added in package.json file to enable esm loader for node. 
- Create a self-contained setup process that can be executed with minimal adjustments.


Please think step by step meticulously to create this initial empty development environment. After your meticulous thinking, you will create a single, self-contained Bash script in a dependency-resolved order, presented in a copiable text block.

[UserRequirement]
Application Type: Node.js console application
Application Summary: This application is an intelligent RPA designed to automate the process of booking train tickets on https://www.12306.cn/index/. It utilizes TypeScript and Puppeteer for web interactions, and integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently navigate and interact with web pages based on the current URL and the application's objective. The application dynamically requests user inputs throughout the booking process and uses this information, along with intelligent reasoning, to automate the booking task without manual identification of webpage elements.

Frameworks and Libraries:
- Node.js: Runtime environment for executing the application.
- TypeScript: Programming language for developing the application, offering type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- Puppeteer: Library for automating web browser interactions, essential for navigating web pages and simulating user actions.
- LLM Integration (Specific LLM library/framework to be determined): For intelligent reasoning about webpage elements and automation logic based on the application's goal and the current URL.


{here is user requirement}
- **Application Type**: Appoint booking app

- **Configuration**:
  - The user will provide a correct `config.json` structure. 
  - `config.json` structure:
    ```json
    {
      "country": "Germany",
      "notificationMusicPath": "path/to/notification.mp3",
      "failureLabelCSS": "CSS_SELECTOR_VALUE"
    }
    ```
  - If the `config.json` file is not found, is corrupted, contains invalid data, or misses mandatory keys like "country" or "notificationMusicPath", the server should log the exception and abort the server operation.

- **Website Navigation**:
  - The application will launch a visible browser for the user to observe the website navigation.
  - Navigate to [https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen](https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen).
  - Click the "Termin Buchen" button.
  - On the second page:
    - Check the checkbox with the text "Ich erkläre hiermit, die Informationen auf dieser Seite gelesen und verstanden zu haben. Mit der Nutzung dieses Service-Angebots erteile ich meine Zustimmung zur Erhebung und Nutzung meiner persönlichen Daten.*".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - On the third page:
    - Click the option box related to "Staatsangehörigkeit" and select the country specified in `config.json`.
    - Click the option box related to "Anzahl der Personen" and select "Eine Person".
    - Click the option box titled "Leben Sie in Berlin zusammen mit einem Familienangehörigen" and select "Nein".
    - Click the box "Aufenthaltstitel - verlängern".
    - From the list of checkboxes that appear, select "Aufenthaltserlaubnis für eine qualifizierte Beschäftigung in der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - In case of navigation issues or if the website updates its UI and elements don't match expectations: 
    - The server should log the error in a timestamped log file named "error_log_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt" in a "logs" folder and abort the operation.

- **Check for Appointments and Notification**:
  - Continuously check for available appointments from 8:00 to 18:00.
  - Handle appointments as specified.
  - On finding an appointment, play an mp3 music file from the path specified in `config.json` as a notification. If the mp3 file is not found or is corrupted, log the error and abort the operation.
  - If no appointment is available, play the "Failure" mp3 file from the path specified in `config.json` as notification.
  - Wait for 5 minutes before rechecking.

- **General**:
  - The application should operate autonomously once started.
  - Libraries to be used: Puppeteer
  - Best practices will be followed for logging formats, codebase structuring, library versions, and handling of exceptions or errors not explicitly covered in the provided requirements.
