### Fully Detailed Requirements with Triggering Actions

1. **Intelligent Webpage Element Identification**
   - **Triggered by**: The user starting the application.
   - **Action**: The application uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the current URL and specified goals, identifying the necessary webpage elements for the booking process.
   - **Output**: A set of identified webpage elements ready for interaction.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the dynamic user input prompting process.
   - **Dependencies**: None. This action is foundational for the workflow.

2. **Dynamic User Input Prompting**
   - **Triggered by**: Completion of the intelligent webpage element identification process.
   - **Action**: Based on the identified webpage elements and inferred actions, the application dynamically prompts the user for specific inputs required for the booking process.
   - **Output**: Collected user inputs necessary for proceeding with the booking.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the automated booking process.
   - **Dependencies**: Relies on the completion of the intelligent webpage element identification (Requirement 1).

3. **Automated Booking Process**
   - **Triggered by**: Collection of all necessary user inputs.
   - **Action**: Leveraging the identified webpage elements and user-provided inputs, the application automates the process from launching the root URL to successfully booking a train ticket, navigating through the 12306.cn website without manual user intervention.
   - **Output**: A booking confirmation indicating successful ticket purchase.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the QR code payment processing.
   - **Dependencies**: Dependent on the completion of dynamic user input prompting (Requirement 2).

4. **QR Code Payment Processing**
   - **Triggered by**: Receiving a successful booking confirmation.
   - **Action**: The application supports QR code generation for payment, incorporating intelligent mechanisms to wait for the user to scan the QR code and complete the payment process.
   - **Output**: Payment confirmation, indicating successful transaction completion.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates error reporting in case of payment failure.
   - **Dependencies**: Follows the successful completion of the automated booking process (Requirement 3).

5. **Error Reporting**
   - **Triggered by**: Any errors, failures, or exceptions detected during the webpage element identification, user input collection, booking process, or payment processing.
   - **Action**: The application captures and reports any errors or booking failures encountered during the process, displaying detailed error messages on the command line to inform the user of what went wrong.
   - **Output**: Error messages displayed to the user, providing clear and immediate feedback.
   - **Triggering**: None. This action concludes the process or prompts for restart/rectification based on the error type.
   - **Dependencies**: Integrated with all steps (Requirements 1 through 4) to monitor and report issues as they arise.
