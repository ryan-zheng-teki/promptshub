### Fully Detailed Requirements with Triggering Actions

1. **Intelligent Webpage Element Identification**
   - **Triggered by**: The user starting the application.
   - **Action**: The application uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the current URL and specified goals, identifying the necessary webpage elements for the booking process.
   - **Output**: A set of identified webpage elements ready for interaction.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the dynamic user input prompting process.
   - **Dependencies**: None. This action is foundational for the workflow.

2. **Dynamic User Input Prompting**
   - **Triggered by**: Completion of the intelligent webpage element identification process.
   - **Action**: Based on the identified webpage elements and inferred actions, the application dynamically prompts the user for specific inputs required for the booking process.
   - **Output**: Collected user inputs necessary for proceeding with the booking.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the automated booking process.
   - **Dependencies**: Relies on the completion of the intelligent webpage element identification (Requirement 1).

3. **Automated Booking Process**
   - **Triggered by**: Collection of all necessary user inputs.
   - **Action**: Leveraging the identified webpage elements and user-provided inputs, the application automates the process from launching the root URL to successfully booking a train ticket, navigating through the 12306.cn website without manual user intervention.
   - **Output**: A booking confirmation indicating successful ticket purchase.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates the QR code payment processing.
   - **Dependencies**: Dependent on the completion of dynamic user input prompting (Requirement 2).

4. **QR Code Payment Processing**
   - **Triggered by**: Receiving a successful booking confirmation.
   - **Action**: The application supports QR code generation for payment, incorporating intelligent mechanisms to wait for the user to scan the QR code and complete the payment process.
   - **Output**: Payment confirmation, indicating successful transaction completion.
   - **Triggering**: Initiates error reporting in case of payment failure.
   - **Dependencies**: Follows the successful completion of the automated booking process (Requirement 3).

5. **Error Reporting**
   - **Triggered by**: Any errors, failures, or exceptions detected during the webpage element identification, user input collection, booking process, or payment processing.
   - **Action**: The application captures and reports any errors or booking failures encountered during the process, displaying detailed error messages on the command line to inform the user of what went wrong.
   - **Output**: Error messages displayed to the user, providing clear and immediate feedback.
   - **Triggering**: None. This action concludes the process or prompts for restart/rectification based on the error type.
   - **Dependencies**: Integrated with all steps (Requirements 1 through 4) to monitor and report issues as they arise.

Requirement Input, Output
Yes, analyzing dependencies among requirements is crucial for ensuring that a system's requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible. This process helps identify how different requirements relate to and affect each other, which is essential for the successful development and implementation of a system. Here's a simplified overview of how dependency analysis can be done:

1. **Identification of Requirements**: Initially, all the requirements of the system are gathered and documented. This includes functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system performs a function).

2. **Requirements Categorization**: Once the requirements are gathered, they are categorized based on their nature and functionality. This helps in understanding and managing their interdependencies more effectively.

3. **Dependency Mapping**: In this step, a dependency map is created. This involves identifying and documenting the relationships between different requirements. There are several types of dependencies that can be identified, such as:
   - **Functional Dependencies**: Where the output of one requirement serves as input for another.
   - **Data Dependencies**: When one requirement produces data that another requirement uses.
   - **Constraint Dependencies**: Where one requirement restricts or influences the implementation of another.

4. **Analysis Tools and Techniques**: Various tools and techniques can be used to analyze and visualize these dependencies, such as:
   - **Dependency Matrices**: A matrix that shows the relationship between requirements, indicating dependencies.
   - **Graphical Modeling Tools**: Tools like UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams can visually represent the relationships and dependencies among requirements.
   - **Traceability Matrices**: These matrices track the relationships between requirements throughout the project lifecycle, helping identify dependencies and their impacts.

5. **Review and Validation**: This involves reviewing the dependency analysis with stakeholders to validate the completeness and correctness of requirements. It's also a stage to identify any missing requirements or dependencies that might have been overlooked.

6. **Continuous Management and Refinement**: As the project evolves, the requirements and their dependencies may change. Continuous management and refinement of these dependencies are necessary to keep the project aligned with its goals and to accommodate changes.

This process involves a lot of collaboration among project stakeholders, including business analysts, developers, and end-users, to ensure that all dependencies are correctly identified and managed. Dependency analysis is a critical part of requirements engineering, which aims to ensure that the final system fully meets the needs it was designed to address.
