Version 1:
You are a requirements engineer tasked with breaking down a large software requirement into smaller, business-functional, and independent yet cooperative modules.

**Context**:
In software engineering, modularization facilitates the management of complex requirements by dividing a large requirement into smaller, business-focused modules. Each module addresses a specific set of  business requirements. Non-functional requirements, or technical requirements, such as coding standards and library integration are embedded within relevant business modules, rather than existing as separate modules. This approach ensures that each module solves certain business requirments with related technical requirements contained in the module itself.

**Example**:
Consider a more detailed example of a bookstore website. This website might have the following modules:
- **User Management Module**: Handles user accounts, profiles, and authentication. It ensures users can sign up, log in, and manage their personal information securely.
- **Inventory Management Module**: Manages the books available for sale, including adding new books, updating book information, and tracking stock levels.
- **Search and Recommendation Module**: Allows users to search for books and provides recommendations based on user preferences and browsing history.
- **Payment Module**: Handles transactions, including payment processing, invoicing, and managing different payment methods.
- **Order Fulfillment Module**: Oversees the process from order placement to delivery, including order tracking, shipping management, and returns.
- **Customer Service Module**: Provides support for customer inquiries and issues, integrating features like live chat and ticketing systems.

**Criteria**:
Ensure each module is clearly defined and covers a distinct business functionality of the application. The modules should collectively encompass the entire scope of the larger requirement without redundancy.


**Procedure**:
1. Identify key business functionalities of given user requirements.
2. Develop modules based these business functionalities, refer to Context section for how requirement modularization works.

**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step objective, formatting each step with the exact title as specified in the procedure, and ensuring the content under each step directly relates to the step's purpose, thus maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Identify key business functionalities of given user requirements.
  {Elaborate on the analysis or action taken in this step, ensuring it aligns with the step's title.}

Follow the steps outlined in the `[Procedure]` section. Take a deep breath, think step by step, and reason comprehensively for each step. The output should adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.

[UserRequirement]
I have created one requirement as listed below.

- **Application Type**:  Automated appoint booking application.

- **Configuration**:
  - The user will provide a correct `config.json` structure. 
  - `config.json` structure:
    ```json
    {
      "country": "Germany",
      "notificationMusicPath": "path/to/notification.mp3",
      "failureLabelCSS": "CSS_SELECTOR_VALUE"
    }
    ```
  - If the `config.json` file is not found, is corrupted, contains invalid data, or misses mandatory keys like "country" or "notificationMusicPath", the server should log the exception and abort the server operation.

- **Website Navigation**:
  - The application will launch a visible browser for the user to observe the website navigation.
  - Navigate to [https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen](https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen).
  - Click the "Termin Buchen" button.
  - On the second page:
    - Check the checkbox with the text "Ich erkläre hiermit, die Informationen auf dieser Seite gelesen und verstanden zu haben. Mit der Nutzung dieses Service-Angebots erteile ich meine Zustimmung zur Erhebung und Nutzung meiner persönlichen Daten.*".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - On the third page:
    - Click the option box related to "Staatsangehörigkeit" and select the country specified in `config.json`.
    - Click the option box related to "Anzahl der Personen" and select "Eine Person".
    - Click the option box titled "Leben Sie in Berlin zusammen mit einem Familienangehörigen" and select "Nein".
    - Click the box "Aufenthaltstitel - verlängern".
    - From the list of checkboxes that appear, select "Aufenthaltserlaubnis für eine qualifizierte Beschäftigung in der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - In case of navigation issues or if the website updates its UI and elements don't match expectations: 
    - The server should log the error in a timestamped log file named "error_log_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt" in a "logs" folder and abort the operation.

- **Check for Appointments and Notification**:
  - On finding an appointment, play an mp3 music file from the path specified in `config.json` as a notification. If the mp3 file is not found or is corrupted, log the error and abort the operation.
  - If no appointment is available, play the "Failure" mp3 file from the path specified in `config.json` as notification.
  - Wait for 5 minutes before rechecking.

- **General**:
  - The application should operate autonomously once started.
  - Libraries to be used: Puppeteer, playsound, and Python's built-in logging module.
  - Best practices will be followed for logging formats, codebase structuring, library versions, and handling of exceptions or errors not explicitly covered in the provided requirements.
