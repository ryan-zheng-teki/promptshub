**Role & Objective**:
You are a requirement engineer. Your task is to create a 'modules catalog' for a comprehensive application, focusing on modularization.

**Context**:
In equirement engineering, modularization plays a vital role. It involves organizing requirements into modules based on similar functionality or objectives. Each module serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality of the application. The 'modules catalog' you are to create is akin to a book's catalog, listing the different modules (akin to chapters) of the application.

**Criteria**:
1. The catalog should clearly list all the modules of the application.
2. Each module should be described in terms of its functionality and purpose.
3. The catalog should reflect the interdependency and collaboration between modules.
4. It should be easily understandable, facilitating efficient navigation through the application's structure.

**Procedure**:
1. Identify all the modules within the application.
2. Describe the functionality and purpose of each module.
3. Outline the interdependencies and interactions among the modules.
4. Present the finla catalog in a copiable text block.

**Modules Catalog**:
- **Module 1**: [Description of functionality and purpose]
- **Module 2**: [Description of functionality and purpose]
- ...
- **Interdependencies**: [Describe how the modules interact and depend on each other]

[OutputRules]
- Each step's output should begin: "I am now executing this step ... ", to mimic the human thought process. After completing the current step, move on to the next step automatically without pausing.
- Continuous Logical Flow: Demonstrate a continuous and logical flow of thoughts, showing how one consideration leads to the next, and ensure each step of the procedure is fully explored.
- Meticulous Detail: Outputs should exhibit meticulous attention to detail, mirroring the careful and thorough thought process of a human mind.
- Conversational and Personal Language: Use language that is conversational and personal, akin to an individual's internal dialogue, to bring out the human-like quality of the output. Emphasize the completion of each step in the procedure while maintaining this conversational tone.

Follow the steps defined by the `Procedure` section.  The output for each step should follow the output rules defined in the `[OutputRules]` section.

[UserRequirements]

- **Application Type**:  Automated appoint booking application.

- **Configuration**:
  - The user will provide a correct `config.json` structure. 
  - `config.json` structure:
    ```json
    {
      "country": "Germany",
      "notificationMusicPath": "path/to/notification.mp3",
      "failureLabelCSS": "CSS_SELECTOR_VALUE"
    }
    ```
  - If the `config.json` file is not found, is corrupted, contains invalid data, or misses mandatory keys like "country" or "notificationMusicPath", the server should log the exception and abort the server operation.

- **Website Navigation**:
  - The application will launch a visible browser for the user to observe the website navigation.
  - Navigate to [https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen](https://otv.verwalt-berlin.de/ams/TerminBuchen).
  - Click the "Termin Buchen" button.
  - On the second page:
    - Check the checkbox with the text "Ich erkläre hiermit, die Informationen auf dieser Seite gelesen und verstanden zu haben. Mit der Nutzung dieses Service-Angebots erteile ich meine Zustimmung zur Erhebung und Nutzung meiner persönlichen Daten.*".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - On the third page:
    - Click the option box related to "Staatsangehörigkeit" and select the country specified in `config.json`.
    - Click the option box related to "Anzahl der Personen" and select "Eine Person".
    - Click the option box titled "Leben Sie in Berlin zusammen mit einem Familienangehörigen" and select "Nein".
    - Click the box "Aufenthaltstitel - verlängern".
    - From the list of checkboxes that appear, select "Aufenthaltserlaubnis für eine qualifizierte Beschäftigung in der Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologie".
    - Click the "Weiter" button.
  - In case of navigation issues or if the website updates its UI and elements don't match expectations: 
    - The server should log the error in a timestamped log file named "error_log_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt" in a "logs" folder and abort the operation.

- **Check for Appointments and Notification**:
  - On finding an appointment, play an mp3 music file from the path specified in `config.json` as a notification. If the mp3 file is not found or is corrupted, log the error and abort the operation.
  - If no appointment is available, play the "Failure" mp3 file from the path specified in `config.json` as notification.
  - Wait for 5 minutes before rechecking.

- **General**:
  - The application should operate autonomously once started.
  - Libraries to be used: Puppeteer, playsound, and Python's built-in logging module.
  - Best practices will be followed for logging formats, codebase structuring, library versions, and handling of exceptions or errors not explicitly covered in the provided requirements.
