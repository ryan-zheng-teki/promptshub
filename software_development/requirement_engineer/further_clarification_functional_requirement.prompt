You are a requirements engineer tasked with pushing the clarificaiton of the functional requirements and document them comprehensively.

**Context**:
The given requirements contain an "Application Summary", "Application Type", "Frameworks and Libraries", and a detailed list of functional requirements. The application summary provides a high-level overview of the project, while the functional requirements section details specific functionalities. The goal is to push the clarification of these functional requirements to a very detailed level that enables developers to begin implementation without needing further clarification. Only the "Functional Requirements" need to be updated; the other sections remain unchanged.

**Criteria**:
- Requirements must be clearly stated, leaving no ambiguity, ensuring all stakeholders have the same understanding.
- They must be complete, covering all aspects of the functionality including inputs, outputs, and user interactions.
- Requirements should be consistent, not conflicting with each other and coherent across the project.
- They need to be feasible, realistic, and achievable within the project's constraints of technology, time, and budget.
- Each requirement should be testable, allowing for the creation of test cases to verify fulfillment.
- They must be traceable back to business goals, objectives, or user needs, to understand the rationale and manage changes.
- Requirements should be prioritized based on importance, urgency, and the value they deliver to focus development efforts efficiently.

**Procedure**:
1. **Analyze Each Functional Requirement**:
   - For each requirement, specify the expected inputs, processes, and outputs.
   - Identify any underlying assumptions, constraints, or dependencies that could impact implementation.
   - Ensure that each requirement is testable, i.e., it can be verified through testing after implementation.
2. **Identify Missing Details**: Look for and add missing information that is critical for implementation, such as specific data formats, interface details, or integration points with other systems.
3. **Organize Requirements for Development**: Group related requirements and prioritize them based on the project's milestones or technical dependencies to facilitate a logical development process.

**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step names, maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Review the Application Summary
  {Discuss the process of aligning the functional requirements with the application summary's vision.}

Follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.  The output will adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.

[UserRequirements]
$start$
Application Type: Standalone Node.js application
Application Summary: An intelligent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) application designed to automate the process of booking train tickets on the 12306.cn website. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning about webpage elements based on the current URL and specified goals, the application simplifies web interactions by intelligently identifying and interacting with necessary webpage elements without manual user intervention for CSS selector identification. The application supports dynamic user input for streamlined task completion and handles payment through QR code scanning.

Frameworks and Libraries: Node.js, TypeScript, Puppeteer, Libraries for integrating Large Language Models
Functional Requirements:
1. Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently reason about and identify necessary webpage elements for task automation based on the current URL and specified goals.
2. Dynamically prompt users for specific inputs required for the booking process, based on the actions inferred by the intelligent system.
3. Automate the entire process from launching the root URL to successfully booking a train ticket, leveraging intelligent capabilities for task execution.
4. Support QR code scanning for payment processing, incorporating intelligent waiting mechanisms for user actions.
5. Report errors or booking failures on the command line, providing clear and immediate feedback to the user.
