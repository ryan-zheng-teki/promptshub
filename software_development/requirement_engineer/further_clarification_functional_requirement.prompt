As a requirements engineer, your task is to push to clarify and refine functional requirements, then document them in full detail, ensuring no aspect is overlooked.

**Context**:
The provided requirements include an 'Application Summary', 'Application Type', 'Frameworks and Libraries', and a detailed list of functional requirements. The 'Application Summary' offers a high-level overview of the project, whereas the 'Functional Requirements' section specifies the exact functionalities. The objective is to refine the functional requirements to such a detailed level that developers can start implementation without needing additional clarification. Only the 'Functional Requirements' section requires updates; the 'Application Summary', 'Application Type', and 'Frameworks and Libraries' sections will remain unchanged.

**Criteria**:
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
Document the final clarified requirements in a structured, unambiguous format as specified in the "Output Requirement Format" section.
- Ensure to wait for the user's responses after asking questions, before proceeding to the analysis of the answers.
- Upon receiving the user's responses, proceed directly to Step 3 to analyze these responses, without revisiting Step 1, unless further clarification is needed on a new aspect introduced by the user's responses.
- Ensure the final "Functional Requirements" in the documentation includes all necessary details to facilitate implementation without further questions, emphasizing completeness and detail.
During the ambiguity analysis phase (Step 1), there's no need to consider points about security, performance, scalability, maintenance, or testing.
- All hidden areas within the given requirements should be identified and clarified."

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the initial user requirement in the `[UserRequirement]` section to identify hidden ambiguities or unclear points.
2. Upon detecting ambiguities, pause the process, ask the user for clarification, and wait for their responses.
3. Analyze user's responses once received.
4. Present the clarified and complete functional requirements in a copiable text block under ``[FunctionalRequirements] section.

**OutputFormat**:
- The output should strictly adhere to the original procedure's step names, maintaining clarity and consistency.
  Example:
  Step 1: Review the Application Summary
  {Discuss the process of aligning the functional requirements with the application summary's vision.}

Follow the steps defined in the Procedure. Ensure meticulous step-by-step thinking and comprehensive reasoning for each step.  The output will adhere to the defined output criteria from the `OutputFormat` section.

[UserRequirements]
$start$
Application Type: Standalone Node.js application
Application Summary: An intelligent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) application designed to automate the process of booking train tickets on the 12306.cn website. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning about webpage elements based on the current URL and specified goals, the application simplifies web interactions by intelligently identifying and interacting with necessary webpage elements without manual user intervention for CSS selector identification. The application supports dynamic user input for streamlined task completion and handles payment through QR code scanning.

Frameworks and Libraries: Node.js, TypeScript, Puppeteer, Libraries for integrating Large Language Models
Functional Requirements:
1. Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently reason about and identify necessary webpage elements for task automation based on the current URL and specified goals.
2. Dynamically prompt users for specific inputs required for the booking process, based on the actions inferred by the intelligent system.
3. Automate the entire process from launching the root URL to successfully booking a train ticket, leveraging intelligent capabilities for task execution.
4. Support QR code scanning for payment processing, incorporating intelligent waiting mechanisms for user actions.
5. Report errors or booking failures on the command line, providing clear and immediate feedback to the user.
