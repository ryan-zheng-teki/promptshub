Software architects play a pivotal role in the initial design phase of software requirements, where they create preliminary designs based on user requirements. This initial design typically includes the specification of APIs, each accompanied by a detailed description outlining its contribution to meeting the user requirements. The verification process is a crucial subsequent step, during which the design is scrutinized to ensure completeness and alignment with all specified requirements. This involves comparing each API against every requirement to ascertain that the design encompasses all necessary functionalities. Should the verification process reveal any requirements not addressed by the current design, it necessitates the enhancement of the design to incorporate the missing functionalities. This ensures that the final design adequately achieves all intended objectives as per the user requirements. This task is the second

Understanding and processing user requirements accurately is akin to navigating a decision tree, mirroring human decision-making processes. This approach is essential when interfacing with large language models like ChatGPT. In instances where a user's request is unclear or contains ambiguities, it's crucial to navigate through a decision tree to seek clarification effectively. Each decision point in the tree should include a meticulous analysis and an explicit statement of the subsequent action. This method ensures that user needs are accurately identified and addressed.

Criteria:
- The Q&A session should be iterative, involving the user until all ambiguities are resolved.
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
- The final output should be well-structured, formatted, and free from ambiguities.
- The model should autonomously navigate between nodes in the decision tree, except when seeking user input for clarification.

Decision Tree:
1. Analyze the initial user requirement given in the [UserRequest] section:
   - If no ambiguities: Proceed to step 5.
   - If ambiguities detected: Go to step 2.
2. Initiate a Q&A session for clarification:
   - If user clarifies ambiguously: Return to step 1.
   - If user clarifies clearly: Proceed to step 3.
3. Analyze user's response:
   - If further ambiguities remain: Return to step 2.
   - If no further ambiguities: Proceed to step 4.
4. Summarize the clarified request.
5. Present the clarified and summarized user requirement in a structured format.

Prompt engineering involves designing a directive that guides a large language model in performing specific tasks. An essential aspect of this process is the inclusion of an example section, which serves to concretely demonstrate the task's execution. This approach not only clarifies the prompt's objectives but also mirrors human learning processes, where examples provide practical insights into abstract concepts. Understanding the target prompt's goals is pivotal in generating relevant examples, thereby facilitating a clearer comprehension and implementation of the task at hand.




Enhancing a target prompt for a large language model involves the strategic inclusion of positive and negative examples. This method is intended to sharpen the model's task execution by clearly delineating effective from ineffective prompt structures. Positive examples illustrate the desired approach, showcasing clarity, coherence, and precision, while negative examples highlight common pitfalls, such as vagueness or redundancy. This contrast aids the model in producing more accurate and focused responses, aligning closely with the intended task requirements. 




1 . Good question. This is why this is actually one intelligent RPA app. as we have the goal of the app, the root url. So we deciding process will be you will assume that there is one library to use. Given the goal, the current url, the library internally uses LLM to reason which elements are relevant for the goal, the return will be the elements already. query+current url => elements. No need to worry about how the process works 2. Again, this is a intelligent RPA, not a static, similar to 1 3. Just use normal logs, do not make it complicated.
