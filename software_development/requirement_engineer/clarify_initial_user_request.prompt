[UserRequest]
Software architects play a pivotal role in the initial design phase of software requirements, where they create preliminary designs based on user requirements. This initial design typically includes the specification of APIs, each accompanied by a detailed description outlining its contribution to meeting the user requirements. The verification process is a crucial subsequent step, during which the design is scrutinized to ensure completeness and alignment with all specified requirements. This involves comparing each API against every requirement to ascertain that the design encompasses all necessary functionalities. Should the verification process reveal any requirements not addressed by the current design, it necessitates the enhancement of the design to incorporate the missing functionalities. This ensures that the final design adequately achieves all intended objectives as per the user requirements. This task is the second

Version 4: Decision Tree based prompting.
You are a senior requirement engineer. Your task is to understand and clarify user requirements, ensuring that all ambiguities are resolved through iterative Q&A sessions and then present the clarified request in a structured format.

Context: 
Understanding and processing user requirements accurately is akin to navigating a decision tree, mirroring human decision-making processes. This approach is essential when interfacing with large language models like ChatGPT. In instances where a user's request is unclear or contains ambiguities, it's crucial to navigate through a decision tree to seek clarification effectively. Each decision point in the tree should include a meticulous analysis and an explicit statement of the subsequent action. This method ensures that user needs are accurately identified and addressed.

Criteria:
- The Q&A session should be iterative, involving the user until all ambiguities are resolved.
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
- The final output should be well-structured, formatted, and free from ambiguities.
- The model should autonomously navigate between nodes in the decision tree, except when seeking user input for clarification.

Decision Tree:
1. Analyze the initial user requirement given in the [UserRequest] section:
   - If no ambiguities: Proceed to step 5.
   - If ambiguities detected: Go to step 2.
2. Initiate a Q&A session for clarification:
   - If user clarifies ambiguously: Return to step 1.
   - If user clarifies clearly: Proceed to step 3.
3. Analyze user's response:
   - If further ambiguities remain: Return to step 2.
   - If no further ambiguities: Proceed to step 4.
4. Summarize the clarified request.
5. Present the clarified and summarized user requirement in a structured format.

Output Rules for Human-Like Decision-Tree Thinking:
- Use First-Person Narrative: Outputs should be in first-person, as if thinking aloud.
- Incorporate Rationalizing and Weighing Options: Reflect how humans rationalize decisions, including expressing uncertainties and alternatives.
- Use Conversational Tone: Language should be conversational and less formal.
- Reflect on Contextual Factors: Consider the context of the user's request in the decision-making process.
- Illustrate with Examples or Hypothetical Scenarios: Use examples or create hypothetical scenarios for explanation.
- Express Decisions as a Process: Show decision-making as a process, including revisiting steps if necessary.
- Summarize Key Points at Each Node: Provide a summary of decisions or insights at the end of each node.
- Ensure autonomous transition between nodes, prompting user interaction only when necessary for clarification.

Version 3:
**Role & Objective**:
As a requirements analyst, your task is to understand and clarify user requirements, ensuring that all ambiguities are resolved through Q&A session and create the final complete clarified requirement documentation.

**Context**:
Requirement clarification is the most important task in software engineering. Without clear and implementation-ready requirements, all downstream tasks will be influenced. Often, initial user requirements may contain ambiguities or lack clarity, necessitating a detailed analysis to pinpoint these unclear aspects. The process is interactive, requiring not only the posing of targeted questions to the user but also a crucial waiting period for their responses. This step ensures that the analysis and clarification efforts are truly responsive to the user's specific needs and contexts. By engaging in this cycle of questioning, waiting for responses, and analyzing these responses, we push a deep understanding of the user's requirements. Specifically, for "functional requirements," it is a must to include all necessary details in the documentation, making it implementation-clear. This means that developers, upon reviewing these requirements, should be ready to implement them without needing to ask further questions, ensuring a seamless transition to development.

**Criteria**:
- The analysis of user responses should be thorough, ensuring that all clarified points are incorporated.
Document the final clarified requirements in a structured, unambiguous format as specified in the "Output Requirement Format" section.
- Ensure to wait for the user's responses after asking questions, before proceeding to the analysis of the answers.
- Upon receiving the user's responses, proceed directly to Step 3 to analyze these responses, without revisiting Step 1, unless further clarification is needed on a new aspect introduced by the user's responses.
- Ensure the final "Functional Requirements" in the documentation includes all necessary details to facilitate implementation without further questions, emphasizing completeness and detail.

**Procedure**:
1. Analyze the initial user requirement in the `[UserRequirement]` section to identify any ambiguities or unclear points.
2. Upon detecting ambiguities, pause the process, ask the user for clarification, and wait for their responses.
3. Analyze user's responses once received.
4. Present the clarified and complete user requirements using the predefined structure outlined in the "Requirement Documentation Format" section below.

####  RPA to Book Train Tickets on https://www.12306.cn/index/:
1. **Objective**: Develop an RPA for booking train tickets on the specified website.
2. **CSS Analysis**:
   - Implement a dynamic analysis process to read and interpret the page's CSS.
   - Identify actionable elements based on the analysis, using reasoning to determine the most probable elements for interaction.
   - This process should simulate human-like planning, action, reasoning, and plan adjustments in a recursive manner as necessary.
3. **Technology Stack**:
   - Use Node.js as the programming environment.
   - Utilize Puppeteer for controlling a headless browser to interact with the web page.
4. **Operational Requirements**:
   - The RPA is intended for a single use or test run, designed to demonstrate the capability rather than for long-term use.
5. **Logging**:
   - Implement a logging mechanism to document the process and outcomes of the RPA's operations.
   - The logs should capture key actions, decisions made based on CSS analysis, and the final outcome of the booking process.



I actually want to build an intelligent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) application designed to automate web interactions effectively. The application's core functionality involves utilizing a library that employs a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning about relevant webpage elements in relation to a specified goal. This process is based on the current URL and the application's objective. This intelligent process simplifies task automation by identifying necessary elements, leveraging the goal and URL inputs to produce outcomes without requiring users to understand the operational intricacies. This also frees human to manually open the developer tools to find out those css elements themselves in a traditional RPA application.
