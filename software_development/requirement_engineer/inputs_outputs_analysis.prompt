Thank you for your submission. I am now executing this step to understand and restructure your provided information into the clear, well-written format you requested, according to the TaskTemplateStructure. Let's begin by breaking down the original voice-generated text to ensure all relevant details are retained and accurately presented.

- **Task Objective**: The goal is to restructure functional requirements into a specific, clear template format that outlines inputs, processes, and outputs related to those requirements.
  
- **Task Context**: This methodology is introduced to standardize the way functional requirements are documented, ensuring clarity and consistency. It's particularly useful for identifying and articulating the specific inputs and outputs associated with each requirement, as well as describing the process or functionality that links them. This approach is vital for requirements that have clear inputs and outputs, but it also accommodates requirements without such elements by noting them as none.

- **Task Methodology**: Input and Output Analysis.
  - **Description**: This methodology involves transforming each functional requirement into a structured format. This format specifies the inputs required for the requirement, the process or functionality that occurs in response to these inputs, and the outputs or results produced by this process. If a requirement lacks inputs or outputs, these sections are marked as none, ensuring the format remains consistent across all requirements.

- **Task Inputs**:
  - **[Functional Requirements]**:
    - **Description**: The set of functional requirements provided by the user. These requirements describe the specific functionalities or behaviors that a system or component must be able to perform.

- **Task Outputs**:
  - **[Structured Functional Requirements]**:
    - **Description**: A set of functional requirements restructured into the specified template format. Each requirement will be clearly defined with its inputs, process, and outputs, or marked as none if it lacks inputs or outputs.

This structured approach not only facilitates a better understanding of each functional requirement but also aids in their systematic analysis and implementation. Now, let's proceed to the next step.




3. **Input(s)**: Description of the input(s) required for the requirement, including the source of each input.

4. **Process**: Detailed description of the process or functionality that occurs in response to the trigger.

5. **Output**: The expected result or effect produced by the action.
