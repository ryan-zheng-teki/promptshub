**Actually GPT4 knows almost all the knowledge on the planet about software engineering including how to implement them. It is also able to derive the best practices. There should be a standardized way of asking GPT4 to implement a widely seen complete feature for us. Because the features we implement are really simple, and has already been done 1 million times. GPT4 has learnt so much from github. It already knows the best practices of implementing each feature.**

**In software engineering, we normally think about the domain objects first. These domain objects represent the business entities. After we defined the business entities, we define the interactions. The architecture design is about interactions of the business entities. From architecture, we get the interface definitions. and then we provide the implementation of individual methods of those interfaces, GPT4 should already have that knowledge.**


The standard way of using GPT

(1)Several things must be clear to GPT. Its the same to ask a very knowledgable person\[This person knows everything\]

First describe what you want GPT to do for me

Describe the task itself. You have to pretend that even you you can not describe it clearly, GPT has a broad knowledge, it knows your task

If you need the output to be in specific format, describe the format as well
